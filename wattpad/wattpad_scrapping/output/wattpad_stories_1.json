        "chapter_content": " Just a reminder, I have not edited this. So you may see spelling problems and other things. This is just kind of a fun book that I wrote so that's why I never took the time to edit it. ^.^ Enjoy. \nAlso, if you could please take the time to just click \"vote\" it would totally make my day :) \n************************************** \nChapter 1 - The Mansion \nMy name is Kiara Hatake. When I was 7 years old my mother died from a heart attack. Two days ago my father died in a car accident. I am 16 years old and I am now leaving my house to go to someone my dad told me about. Last year my dad told me if anything happened go to that place. Well he's gone and I can't live on my own. So as he told me to I am going to the place. I don't know where it is or who is living there but that's where I'm staying. \nI went over in to the middle of the room and grabbed my duffel bag that had all my clothes in it. As I got my bag and was about to leave the house I breathed in the last scent of the pine wood floor. It always smelt like a pine tree and I loved the scent of it. I would sleep on the floor all the time when I was little. And now this is the time to say goodbye. I've spent my whole life in this house. It's sad to say goodbye. \nI heard the car honk in the drive way. It was Nick. He is a friend of my dad's. They were partners. My dad worked as a Computer Software Engineer and also a Medical Scientist. He was one of the smartest people I have ever known. He tried so hard for letting me have a good life. He worked a lot so I never really got to see him. But whenever he had spare time it would always be with me. Thinking about all this is going to make me cry. I need to snap out of it. \n\"Come on Kiara. This person is waiting.\" Nick yelled from the car. \n\"Okay. I'm coming.\" I said while shutting the house door and then walked to the car. \n\"Are you going to miss it here?\" He asked as I got in the car. \n\"Yeah, I will.\" I said buckling up. \n\"Do you have everything?\" \n\"Yes, I only have 4 bags.\" \n\"For a girl you don't have a lot of clothes.\" \n\"I don't go shopping a lot.\" \nHe backed the car out of the drive way and went on the road. I rolled down the window to let some air in. \n\"Do you know who this guy is?\" I asked breathing in the fresh air. \n\"I have no idea.\" He said \"But if your dad said this was the person to go to then I'll trust him. Remember if anything goes wrong call me. You can always stay at my house.\" \n\"Thanks, but I think I'll be fine. This is my dad's request. I'd rather do what he says.\" \n\"Understood.\" \nSummer Vacation is almost over. School starts on Monday. I only have 3 days left of my vacation. Joyful. I love going to the beach during the summer. I can't say I hate the cold because it doesn't snow where I live. It gets cold but not that cold. I live at Pompano Beach, Florida. It's a very nice place actually. That's why my favorite place is the beach. That's where I went when I was little while my dad was working. I go there with my friends. I sometimes like to go alone to read or listen to my iPod. I don't usually go swimming. I'm not that good at swimming. Especially deep parts. \n\"Are you going to be okay there?\" Nick asked interrupting my thoughts. \n\"Huh? Oh, yeah. This guy can't be all that bad. If he's friends with my dad then it's fine.\" \n\"Well your dad picks weird friends. I've seen them before.\" \n\"Are you one of them?\" \n\"Ha-ha very funny. I am actually a normal one out of all your dad's friends.\" I looked out the window as he talked \"Your dad, he was something alright. He never left work until he accomplished something. I always had this strange feeling that he was keeping something from me but I never found out what it was or even if he was keeping something. You have to come over to my place at least once a week. You need to help me get rid of his stuff and what you want to keep. Just think maybe you'll find something out that you never knew before. He's kept a lot of secrets. Maybe one is about you.\" \n\"Doubt it.\" I whispered \nWe were passing by a lot of trees and I didn't see any houses nearby. Actually I haven't even been to this part of Pompano Beach. We came by a black gate that stretched down the road for a while. The trees were behind the gate so I couldn't really make out what was behind them. \n\"This is it.\" He said turning right up to the opening of the gate. \n\"This is it?\" I asked \n\"Yep. This is the place.\" \n\"You gotta be kidding me.\" \nHe stopped at the gate and it opened as soon as we got there. He pulled in further up the long drive way to the house. Well I wouldn't really call it a house it was more like a mansion. The gates closed behind us. I looked out the window and I saw all open field and behind the house was all woods. He must be filthy rich to have this kind of house and land. Nick came to a complete stop as soon as we were close enough to the mansion. \n\"Do you want me to come in with you?\" Nick asked \n\"Uh, No I think I can do this on my own.\" I said unbuckling my seat belt. \n\"Are you sure? I would like to meet the guy.\" \n\"If you're so concerned then come in.\" I said opening the car door. \n\"I am and I will.\" He said getting out of the car. \nHe got my 2 of my bags in the back seat and I got my other 2. We walked up the cement stairwell to the door. The door was a bronze color. It had a fancy white design on the front but I couldn't really tell what it was. Nick knocked on the door. Someone came to the door immediately and opened it. \n\"Hello there.\" A butler said. He looked in his 20's. A handsome guy. He had brown short hair that spiked a little bit and he had dark eyes. It looked kind of black but they were a very dark, dark brown. His skin looked very pale. Not really a tan color. \"Can I help you?\" He asked \n\"Yes, this is Kiara. We were told this was the place to come.\" Nick said \n\"Oh yes, yes please come in.\" He said opening the door wider. \nWe walked in and he closed the door. I looked around. The floors were shiny white that I could see my reflection. The ceiling was high up with a golden chandelier hanging down. I looked to my right and it looked like a living room to me. It had fancy old furniture and big colorful windows. I looked to my left and I couldn't tell what was that way. It turned a corner so I couldn't see. Ahead of me was a wide staircase that lead up stairs. When you are up the stairs you can either go left or right. To the left of the stair case looked like another hall but I didn't move over to see how far it went down. \n\"The master will be right with you.\" The butler said. \nI turned around to face the butler. \"Who's the ma-?\" He wasn't there. Where did he go? \n\n\n"

But all I felt was his breath on my neck. I felt frightened. I didn't know what this idiot is going to do to me. \n\"I won't hurt you.\" He said and looked at me. \"I wouldn't do that to you. But I am a vampire and if you tell anyone about this than I might just have to turn you into one of us.\" \nI couldn't speak. I felt very scared. Was this guy serious? What the hell is he trying to do? I hardly know him yet he threatens me that if I say anything about him being a \"Vampire\" that he would turn me into one. Yeah right. I'm not scared of that. If - if my father sent me here then he's not one. My dad would want me to be protected not be threatened and scared. \nJordan backed away from me. \"Follow me to your room.\" He said \nI picked up two bags and the butler carried the other two bags that Nick left next to the door. I walked up stairs behind Jordan. He walked gracefully up the stairs. His beautiful blonde hair swayed back and forth as he walked. I couldn't help to stare. Although he says he's a vampire I might want to stay away from him . . . just in case it is true. Not saying it is or anything. I looked behind me and the butler was staring at me with these strange eyes like he was dazing over me or something. I looked back in front of me. When we got at the top of the stairs I looked down both halls. There were doors on each side. Who knows what's inside them? \nJordan went to the right and we went down to the end of the hall which led to the left to another hall with more doors. But we didn't go that way. He stopped at the last door to the right. He opened the door. \n\"This is where you'll be staying.\" He said \nI went inside. It looked like the room was made just for me. The bed was in the back right corner. It had a beautiful shade of blue just how I like it. I looked to my left and in the front left corner there was a tan couch and a 24 inch TV on a stand. There was a bathroom to the left side and to my right was a closet. Next to the closet was a dresser with a mirror and a chair. In the middle of the room was just a wooden table with a couple of chairs around it. The carpet was the shade of my bed sheets. And in the back of the room there were glass doors that led out to a balcony. \n\"This is my room?\" I asked shocked \nI never had this much stuff in my room back at the house. I just had a dresser and a bed. Like I said my dad had to work two jobs to provide for me. So I didn't get much. \n\"Yes, this is your room.\" He said \"I'll leave you to unpack. Call if you need anything.\" He snapped and the butler set my bags down. He bowed to me and shut the door when he left with Jordan. \nI was left alone in my room. I put my bags that I had in my hand and set them on my bed. I took my clothes out and was going to put them in the closet. I pulled the doors open. It was a walk in closet. \nSweet. I never had a walk in closet before. This is awesome! I put all my clothes away in the closet and I set all my coats, hoodies, shoes, purses, hats, and belts in the closet also. I don't wear makeup so I don't need to put any of that stuff in the bathroom. I took my HP laptop out and put it on the wooden table. The cord doesn't reach the plug. Great. \nI heard a knock on the door. \n\"Come in\" I said \nSomeone peeked around the corner. It was a little girl. She looked like she was 10. She had golden hair that curled at the bottom. Her hair was in pig tails and it held it together with little yellow ribbons that matched with her hair. Her skin was pale. She was beautiful and so cute. \n\"Hi.\" She said still hiding behind the door. \n\"Can I help you?\" I asked \nShe walked in all the way. She had a beautiful yellow dress on. \n\"I'm Sam.\" She said skipping over to me. \n\"Hello there Sam. Do you live here?\" I asked \n\"Yes, I do.\" She said excited \"I am glad a new girl showed up.\" She showed her fang teeth like Jordan's were. \"I was getting kind of hungry.\" she said and took my hand and bit into my wrist. \nI screamed in pain. \nSomeone walked in. \"What the hell is going on?\" Jordan yelled. \"Sam!\" He yelled and in the speed of lightning ended up in front of me holding Sam. \"Let go!\" He demanded \nShe let go and took her teeth out of my skin. There were two holes in my skin and the blood went down my arm. She bit me. What the hell? This little 10 year old girl freakin' bit me. What a demon she is. I was deceived by her beauty. I thought she was a nice girl but she's a little devil. \n\"What are you doing Sam!?\" He yelled at her \"I told you not to go near her! You're not strong enough to control yourself! Apologize to her!\" He demanded \nThe little girl looked at me with her sweet little face that had blood dripping down her chin. \"I'm sorry.\" She said \"I can't control myself yet. The smell of a human's blood is over whelming.\" \n\"It's - it's okay.\" I said still scared of the little girl. \n\"Leave.\" Jordan said. \nThe little girl skipped off and left the room. Jordan ended up in front of me looking at my wrist. The blood still dripping down my arm. \n\"It doesn't look too bad.\" Jordan said \"Come here.\" He said pulling me to the bathroom. \nThe bathroom was all white and it was big. Bigger than the bathroom at my house before. That's for sure. For being a bathroom it was beautiful. \nHe got white bandages out and wrapped it around my wrist. \"There. If it starts hurting let me know right away.\" \nI rubbed my wrist. \"You're not kidding, you really are a vampire.\" I said frightened. \n\"Like I said. I am not the only vampire that lives here. There are others in their rooms.\" \n\"All those doors have a . . . vampire in it?\" I said trying to imagine it. \n\"No, not that many. About 20 or so, I think.\" \n\"Why am I here? I'll get killed if I live here!\" I yelled at him. \n\"No, these vampires are very well behaved.\" \n\"Not that little girl.\" I mentioned \n\"Sam? She's new. I let the others keep an eye on her. But I guess she got out somehow. That won't happen again. I won't allow it.\" \n\"So do - do you drink human blood?\" I asked. \n\"No, I don't.\" He said and took out a little bottle. \"I take these.\" \n\"Pills?\" I said looking at a little bottle that had red pills in it. \n\"They help control the desire of human blood. This is what I survive on. I tell everyone to take them that live in this house. You have nothing to fear. Now that you know about us. You're staying here 24/7.\" He said \n\"What?\" \n\"You're being homeschooled this year. You will have all your classes here and all your academics.\" \n\"What?! That wasn't part of the deal! I never heard you say that was part of it!\" \n\"I am sorry. But you live under this roof. You will not leave. You're stuck here.\" \nNo way! I'm not going to be stuck here with vampires! I won't do it! I refuse to. \n\"Dinner is at 6. Call if you need anything.\" He said and ran out within seconds. \n\"What?! I wasn't done arguing!\" I yelled. \nI sighed and looked at my wrist that was wrapped up. I sighed again and went to my bed and laid down. I'm so tired. I think I'll just take a nap. I curled up in a ball and closed my eyes. \n\n\n"

I just ignored it. \nThe person slapped me lightly on my face a couple of times to get me up. \"Get up.\" He said. \nI had no choice but to because this person was just going to get on my nerve. I opened my eyes. The person took their hand off from me. I looked up. \nIt was a teenage boy. He looked the same age as me. He wore a plain white hat. It was one of those winter cloth hats, even though it wasn't cold out. He had brown hair that showed under it and it barely touched his eyebrows. He wore 3 ear rings on his ears. It was two small hoop ones toward the top of his ears and silver stubs toward the bottom. He had pale skin just like the butler, Jordan, and Sam. He wore a black sweatshirt which popped his white skin out more and he wore baggy jeans but you could tell he wore a belt. \n\"It's dinner.\" The guy said. \nI sat up and rubbed my face. I tried to remember what happened today since I was still half asleep. \n\"Everyone is waiting let's go.\" He said. \n\"Who are you?\" I asked looking up at him. \n\"My name is Nile.\" \n\"Nile?\" I repeated. \n\"Yes Nile.\" He said getting angry. \"Get up. Hungry vampires are waiting to eat.\" \n\"Hungry vampires?\" I said confused. \"You're not . . . serving human are you?\" I said slowly. \n\"What? No, just because were vampires doesn't mean we can't eat human food. We live off of blood that doesn't mean that's all we eat.\" He spoke with sarcasm tone. \n\"I'm so sorry I asked.\" I said getting angry and stood up. \n\"Let's go. Come on. Hurry it up.\" He said pulling me toward the door. \nPushy are we. I didn't want to say that out loud because what if I got on one of the vampires bad side. I don't know what their like. I don't want to try to getting them mad. \nAfter we got to the stairs he let me go and rubbed his hand on his shirt like he was disgusted because he touched me. But I didn't tell him to grab me; he did that on his own will choice. We walked down the white stairs that had a golden railing on the side. This place is beautiful. I'm still in shock that I'm living here. I wonder . . . I wonder if my dad knew these people were vampires. Jordan is the only one who really seems nice. Nile has sort of an attitude that just makes you want to slap him. Sam is a little demon girl that is drawn to the smell of blood. The butler, well, he is just plain strange. He freaks me out when he stares at me like he wants to suck my blood. \nI rubbed my neck at the thought of it. Nile looked over his shoulder at me. \n\"What are you doing?\" He asked looking at my hand rubbing my neck. \n\"Huh? Nothing.\" I said putting my hand down. \nWe got to the bottom of the steps. \n\"We're not going to hurt you.\" He said. \"You don't have to worry about someone biting your neck.\" \n\"I - I was just . . .\" \n\"Day dreaming about it. Yeah I know.\" He said and kept walking. \nI followed behind him keeping my mouth shut. We went toward that hall that I looked around the corner earlier. We went down it and took a left. It just led down more halls that split off in to 3 different directions. \n\"How big is this place? It doesn't look this big from the outside.\" I said to Nile. \n\"Oh, yeah I know. This is one of those places that have a spell on it.\" \n\"A spell?\" I asked. Now he's joking. \n\"Yeah, you've never heard of witches?\" \n\"Um, yeah but I always thought they were in fairy tales . . . like vampires.\" \n\"You've got a lot to learn kid.\" \nKid? Who's he calling kid? \n\"The Master's dad knew a witch. She put a spell on this place for him. After The Master's dad past away he gave him this mansion.\" Nile explained. \nWe took a right down another hall. \n\"He passed away?\" I said. \"I thought, I thought vampires live forever.\" \nHe turned around walking backwards and looked at me. \"We do.\" He said. \"I'm not really suppose to be telling you this stuff but, since your living with us you should know. The Master's dad, Jordan's dad, he was human.\" \n\"Human?\" \nHe turned back around. \"Yep. I can't tell you anymore. If you want information ask him yourself.\" \n\"Why can't you?\" I asked. \n\"Because I just can't that's why.\" \nI shut my mouth. After we took like two more turns we finally reached to where we were going. It was the dining room. I froze in the door way. There were a lot of vampires sitting at the table. It was a wooden table that stretched out a long ways. It took up half the middle of the room. Nothing really was different in this room than the others. Same floor, same ceiling. Just different furniture and there were some paintings on the wall. \nSo many vampires. I don't think I can live with this. There must have been at least 30 of them sitting at the table. They all stopped what they were doing and looked at me. Nile stopped and looked at me too. \n\"What are you doing? Come on.\" He whispered. \nI shook my head frightened as ever. \nJordan was sitting at the end of the table that was closest to me and stood up. \"Everyone, this is Kiara Hatake. Please make her feel welcomed.\" \n\"Come on.\" Nile said going behind me and pushing me toward the table. He took me to a seat next to Jordan that was the only seat that wasn't taken. \nI felt very nervous sitting at a table with 30 different vampires. They all had pale skin and sharp teeth and these eyes that looked like they wanted to rip my head off. \n\"Let us eat.\" He said and sat down. \nI looked over and all these butlers came out with the food and gave us each a plate. It was steak. Which was kinda weird because mine was well done and everyone else's was almost raw. Like it just came out of the package and was served to them with the blood on it. \nEveryone started eating and talking to each other. I looked to my left. A girl sat next to me with dark black hair that came down to her hips and her eyes were pitch black. She was pretty almost like a goddess. She didn't speak a word to anyone at the table she just kept quiet. I didn't bother to look at anyone else because I didn't know if they would get offended if I did. I just sat there eating my steak. \n\"Are you enjoying the mansion?\" Jordan asked me. \nI looked over at him. \"Yes, it's gorgeous. I've never really been in a mansion before.\" \nHe didn't really reply back to me he just kind of gazed at me. I didn't mind it because something was telling me that I could trust him. But, the others just give me a chill. I just skimmed over the people at the table and I met a couple of people's eyes staring at me. I quickly looked down at my plate as soon as I met their eyes. I think I should just stare at the plate and eat. Don't even look up. \n\nThis comment may be offensive. \n\n"

I'll be going to Nick's house today. I won't have to be with stupid vampires today. I'm so happy. Being with vampires is harsh. Especially when there are 30 of them in the house. What if they all attack me? I'd be a goner. No, no that wouldn't happen. I have to trust Jordan on what he says. They won't hurt me. \nAfter I was ready it was 5 minutes to 10. Minds well go down stairs and wait for Nick to come. I got my white purse and came out of my bedroom. I looked around. No one was around. That's good. I won't have to run into any vampires. I made sure again there was no one around then ran down the hall trying to be quiet at the same time. I stopped before I got to the stairs so no one would see me running. I looked around the corner. No one was down stairs. That's good. \nI walked down the stairs and got to the door. \n\"Going already?\" \nI got scared and turned around fast. It was just Jordan. He was sitting on the step with his back leaning against the wall and his feet up on the step. Was - was he there when I came down stairs? No, he couldn't have been because I would have passed him. \n\"Yes, I told Nick to come at 10.\" I said almost with my voice shaking a bit. \n\"Why so early?\" He asked just like Nick did yesterday. \n\"I thought I would get a good start on going through my dad's stuff. That's all.\" \nHe stood up. \"You're not scared are you?\" He asked. \n\"No.\" I said with a stern voice. \n\"Just wondering.\" He said. \nI heard a honk outside. Nick! \n\"When are you coming home?\" He asked. \nHome? This isn't my home. What is he talking about? I do live here though . . . I just wanted to live here because my dad told me to. But now that I know their secret. I don't think I want to. \n\"Around 8. Is that okay?\" I asked. \nHe nodded. \"Have fun.\" \nI went to go open the door but that butler from yesterday already had it open. He stared at me with these strange eyes. \n\"Goodbye.\" The butler said. \n\"Bye.\" I said scared and ran out of the house and down the stairs. I got in to Nick's car. \n\"Are you in a rush or something?\" Nick asked. \n\"What? No, no. I just missed you.\" I said making that up. \n\"Aw, that's so sweet. But I already have a girlfriend.\" \nI slapped myself in the head. \"Idiot.\" I whispered. \n\"I'm just kidding.\" He said rubbing my head. \nNick turned the car around and we left the mansion. I felt so much of a relief. I can now be comfortable with myself. \n\"How was your night here?\" Nick asked as he drove down the road. \n\"Huh? Oh, fine.\" I said lying. \n\"Did you explore around the mansion?\" \n\"If you mean exploring as in getting lost yeah I did.\" \nHe laughed. \"You got lost?\" \n\"Yes and it wasn't funny. Ni -.\" Shout I can't say Nile's name. Nick doesn't know there are others living in the mansion. \"Neither . . . Jordan and I got lost again after that.\" I said looking out the window knowing that didn't make sense. \n\"Yeah . . .\" He said confused. \"Did you have something for breakfast? We can go out to a good restaurant.\" \n\"That would be good.\" I said looking at him. \nNick found a good restaurant to go to and that's where we ate breakfast. We sat down next to a window and I ate some pancakes. I haven't had pancakes in forever! \n\"I feel like something is wrong.\" Nick said. \n\"What do you mean?\" I said then stuffed a piece of pancake in my mouth. \n\"You. You seem, I don't know, scared.\" \nI froze. I don't know what to tell him. I've been scared since yesterday after he left. I didn't really sleep at all last night. I kept looking around my room in case there was someone in there. \n\"Then your arm.\" He said. \"What happened to your arm? Did - did he hurt you?\" He asked. \nOh no. I forgot. I still had my bandage on. What do I say? \n\"Oh, this.\" I said. \"I fell . . . . in the hall when I got lost. And there was this table and when I fell I hit my arm against it and it started bleeding so Jordan wrapped my arm up.\" I can't believe it. That actually made sense. I wonder if he'll believe it though. \n\"Poor Kiara, always hurting yourself.\" \n\"Ha-ha yeah.\" I said uneasy. \nPhew, I can't believe that he fell for that. That was such a close one. I have to watch it. \n\"Are you sure he's not hurting you though?\" He asked. \n\"No, he's been very nice to me actually. You can even hang out with him and -.\" \n\"No, no that's okay I believe you.\" He said cutting me off. \nGood. Gosh, this is going to be so hard keeping this. \n\"But, you still seem scared.\" He added. \n\"I'm . . . a little nervous around him that's all.\" I said making it up. \n\"Aw, do you have a crush on him?\" \nI took my leg and kicked him so hard under the table. \n\"Never!\" I yelled at him. \"I'm just not use to him yet. Gosh, I can't believe you.\" \nHe pulled his leg up on the chair next to him. \"Man, remind me not to get on your bad side next time.\" He said rubbing his leg. \nIt's true. I can get really nasty when I'm mad. \nLater, we were at Nick's house and we went in the bedroom where he put all the boxes of stuff we had to go through. I sighed. \n\"I don't want to do this.\" I complained. For one thing, I'm still not over my dad dying and for another thing it's just too many boxes. \n\"Well. We better get started.\" He said going over to a box. \nI dragged my feet while I went over to one of them and opened it up. Photo's . . . \n\"You can do this one.\" I said pushing the box toward him then opened another one. Papers . . . Uh . . . What am I suppose to do with these? It's all his work papers. \nI picked one of them up and tried reading it. Right. I can't understand any of this. I'll do this box last. I pushed it over to the side. \n\"You know, if you keep pushing the boxes aside we'll never get it done.\" Nick said. \n\"Well that one has papers in it so I'll just do it last. And I really don't want to look at photos right now.\" \n\"Do you want to do this some other time?\" He asked. \n\"No, no I'll do another box.\" I went over and got another box and opened it. Clothes . . . I pushed it toward Nick. \"You can take it to one of those homeless shelters.\" I said. \n\"Okay . . .\" He said and put it out in the hall. \nBox after box after box. I'm getting so tired of this. After three hours of this I laid down on the floor not wanting to look at another box. Most of my dad's stuff was papers. I don't know what to do with all of it. Throw them out? Maybe his work would want them. There might be important stuff in there for him. It's not important to me. I don't even understand any of it. \n\"You thirsty?\" Nick asked me when he was finished taking the boxes to his car that we were getting rid of. \n\"Yes!\" I said making that clear I wanted something to drink now. \n\"Come down stairs.\" He said and walked away. \nI groaned. \"I don't want to go down stairs!\" I complained. \n\"I guess you're not getting a drink then.\" He said going down the stairs. \nI sighed and got up from the floor. I was so hot. Nick hasn't put any air conditioning in yet. He needs to get it now before I die from the heat. I walked down stairs and went in to the kitchen. His kitchen was basically all blue. It matched the outside of his house well. Nick set a glass of lemonade on the counter. \n\"There you go.\" He said. \nI went over and grabbed it. \"Thanks.\" I took a big gulp and almost drank the whole thing of it. \nNick sat on the counter with the glass in his hand. \"I'm exhausted.\" He said. \"We can do the rest of the boxes next week. I don't want to do anymore.\" \n\"Me neither.\" I said. \nThere was a knock on the door. \n\"Wonder who that is.\" Nick said. \n\"I'll get it.\" I put my glass on the counter and went to the front door. I opened it up. \nNo way. \n\"Hi, I'm Richard.\" He held out his hand. \nPale skin. Sharp teeth. You're not coming in this house. I slammed the door and locked it. \n\"Who was it?\" Nick asked from the kitchen. \nThe person knocked again. \nNo please go away. \nNick hopped off the counter and came over to me. \"What are you doing?\" He asked and unlocked the door and opened it back up. \"Richard?\" \nHuh? Nick knows him. Oh my gosh! I didn't know Nick knew a vampire. Is Nick a vampire? No he doesn't have pale skin or sharp teeth. Oh boy. I'm so confused. \n\n\n"

How've you been?\" He said about to go hug him. \n\"Don't touch him!\" I screamed at him nervous. I covered my mouth knowing that was a bad idea. \n\"Kiara.\" Nick said. \"What's been up with you?\" \n\"I'm sorry.\" I said uncovering my mouth. \n\"Who's this charming lady?\" Richard said. \n\"This is my friend's daughter.\" \n\"Oh, the one who died?\" Richard said like he already knew. \n\"Yeah.\" Nick said disappointed. \nRichard came up to me and bent forward making him eye to eye with me. \"Sorry kid.\" He said rubbing my head then stood up straight. \"So what have you been up to?\" He asked Nick. \nI didn't listen to Nick's answer I was thinking how Richard is a vampire. Does Nick know about them? Am I picturing pale skin and sharp teeth and don't know it? No, no it's definitely real. Who is this guy? Does - does he know who I am? \n\"That's pretty rough on her isn't it?\" Richard said to Nick. \n\"Yeah . . .\" Nick and Richard looked at me. \n\"Uh - did you want me to leave?\" I asked. \n\"No.\" Nick said. \"You're fine.\" \n\"I wanted to hang out but it looks like you're already doing something.\" Richard said. \n\"No, it's fine. We're done for the day. You can stay.\" \nNo, say no. Just one word would make me so happy. Say no. Go home blood sucker! \n\"No that would take away the time between you two.\" Richard said. \nYes, keep going. Go outside and back to your car. \n\"No it wouldn't. I spend enough time with her.\" \nOh no he didn't! He better not say that again. \n\"Are you sure?\" He asked. \n\"Yeah, it's fine.\" \nNo it's not. Please go away. I already have enough of vampires. I wanted to come here to be away from them not to be stuck with you! \n\"Okay.\" \nNick shut the door. \"Do you want something to drink? I made some lemonade.\" \nYeah he wants blood that's what he wants. \n\"No, I'm fine.\" He said. \nNick looked at his watch. \"I forgot to ask Kiara. When are you suppose to be back?\" \n\"I told him 8.\" \n\"She doesn't live with you?\" Richard asked. \n\"Nah, she lives with Jordan Trent now. I asked her to stay but she said she wanted to do what her dad said and live with him.\" \n\"Jordan Trent, huh?\" He looked at me. \nOh no. I think he knows that I know he's a vampire. \n\"Yeah . . .\" Nick said confused. \"Listen, I have to go to the store . . .\" \n\"I'll go.\" I said cutting him off. \n\"I don't trust you driving my car.\" Nick said. \n\"Please can I go?\" I said about to get down on the floor and beg him. \n\"Fine, I guess. But it's a long list.\" He warned me. \n\"I don't care.\" \nHe got his wallet out and handed me some money and a list of stuff. He got his car keys out of his pocket and was about to give them to me. \n\"Don't drive into anything.\" \nI went to go grab them and moved his hand back. \n\"Don't scratch it either.\" \nI went to go grab them again but he pulled his hand away. \n\"And lock the doors when you get out.\" \n\"Would you give me the damn car keys!\" I yelled at him. \nI hear Richard laugh under his breath. \n\"Here\" He gave them to me. \n\"Thank you.\" I said sarcastically and got my purse that was on the couch in the living room then went outside to his car. \nHis car is a Hummer. It's kind of an aqua color but more of a light blue. I love his car. I rarely drive it. He's so worried I'll crash into something. I should do it for fun to see what he does. \nI got in the Hummer and drove off down the road to the store. I'm glad I'm away from that guy Richard. He ruined my day! That idiot! If Nick has known Richard for a while now then I don't think Richard will suck his blood, right? I felt like an idiot back there screaming at him. I'm so stupid. I'm being paranoid. Maybe Richard takes those little red pills like Jordan does. That would be great if he did. That means he doesn't drink human blood. \nAfter about 10 min I got to the store and started shopping. What he has on the list is weird. Sardines. Ew, no, I refuse to eat tiny fish in a can. Weird boy. \nMy phone rang. I got it out of my purse. Unknown caller. Should I pick it up? I hesitated whether I should do it but I decided to pick it up. \n\"Hello?\" \n\"Hey Kiara, this is Jordan.\" \n\"Jordan? How'd you get my number?\" \n\"Uh - that doesn't matter right now. Why are you alone in a store?\" \nI froze. What the heck? I looked around. I didn't see him anywhere. How does he know I'm at the store? \n\"What do you mean? I'm not at a store.\" I said lying wondering if really knew I was at the store. \n\"Right. Nice try. You could get hurt by yourself.\" \n\"I'm not going to get hurt.\" \n\"I haven't told you, but now that you're living with us . . . you might be tracked.\" \nI looked around making sure no one was watching me. \n\"Tracked?\" I repeated. \n\"Other vampires don't like accepting humans into their lives. For that to stop, some, let's say will attack the humans to stay away.\" \n\"Yeah but that doesn't make sense because there is one at my house right now.\" \n\"What?\" He said confused. \nUh oh. Maybe I shouldn't have told him that part. \n\"Who?\" He asked. \n\"His name is Richard.\" \nHe laughed. \"Richard?\" \n\"Yeah . . .\" \n\"Don't worry about that guy. He won't hurt you. The last thing he wants to do is attack a human.\" \n\"That's good.\" I said relieved. \n\"Just watch your back, okay? If anything goes wrong call me.\" \n\"K.\" \n\"See you tonight.\" \n\"Bye.\" I hung up the phone. \nSo Richard is a good vampire. I'm glad. You don't know how happy I am for that. Jordan said that theirs vampires that want to attack humans. I haven't really noticed vampires in this area of Florida. Then again I've never looked for any. I'm just going to mind my own business when I come across pale people, that's all. \nLater, I got all the stuff that was on the list and went back to Nick's house. I came in with 4 bags in each hand. I looked down at the wooden floor. Blood? I looked in front of the stairs and the track of spotted blood led to the living room. I froze in fright. Tears fell down my cheek. I was too scared to go in the living room and look to find what had happened. \n\n\n"

The red color looked fresh like something just happened. I set the bags down lightly in front of the door way trying not to make a sound. Jordan said Richard was a good guy but why is there blood on the ground. \nI tip-toed over to the living room following the blooded spots. I turned the corner. No one was in the living room. The blooded spots led to the computer room. I walked over to the room slowly. My breathing was getting heavier and I felt like I was going to pass out because I wasn't getting enough air. \n\"Ow\" I heard Nick say. \nWas Richard hurting him in there? What's going on? I ran in the computer room. \n\"Stop!\" I screamed loudly. \n\"Kiara?\" Nick said sitting in a chair with his left arm held out and his pant leg rolled up on his right leg. \nRichard had bandages in his hand and some peroxide on the desk. He was wrapping his arm up. \n\"Kiara what's wrong? Why are you crying?\" Nick asked. \nI shook my head. \"I thought something bad happened to you.\" I said bawling. \n\"Aw, come here.\" He said. \nI went over to him and squatted down. He put his right arm around me hugging me. \n\"Nothing happened. I just fell down the stairs. I cut myself on my arms and legs.\" Nick said and kissed the top of my head like I was little girl. \"I'm fine.\" \nI felt stupid before this and now I just feel like a plain moron. Richard looked at me and knew exactly what I thought happened. He knew I was thinking that he had hurt Nick. Is it normal to think that? Was I too harsh? \n\"I'm not going to leave you, okay?\" He said and let go of me. \nI really do feel like a kid. Having an older guy hug me saying everything is going to be alright. \n\"Don't worry\" Richard said. \"Dr. Richard is making him all better.\" \n\"She's not a kid moron.\" Nick said kidding. \nRichard and Nick laughed together. I was wrong. Richard is a nice guy and I'm not going to blame anything on him again. I should have taken Jordan's word when he said he won't hurt humans. \n\"After I patch up this guy here why don't we go out for dinner?\" Richard said. \n\"Yeah, that sounds fine. Right?\" Nick said looking at me. \n\"Yeah.\" I said. \nIt was about 5 o'clock so it was almost time for dinner. I was at the store for a couple of hours. Yes I know that is a long time but I didn't want to come back to a place with a vampire. But Richard, Richard seems more like a human to me. He patches up Nick's wounds even though he's bleeding. He must be like Jordan and can control himself. \nI stood up remembering I left the door wide open with the bags still there. \n\"I'm going to put the groceries away.\" I said stuffy from bawling. \n\"Okay.\" Nick said. \nI went to the door and moved all the bags to the kitchen and shut the door. I knew exactly where everything went because I came over here when my dad worked with him. Nick started working with my dad 3 years ago. They were really close together. My mom and dad have already left me on this earth alone. I don't want Nick to do the same. \nWhen I got to the last bag to put stuff away Richard and Nick came into the kitchen. I saw Nick limp on his leg. It must have hurt falling down wooden stairs. Richard went up stairs and got a wet cloth. He had to clean up the blood that was on the floor from Nick. Wouldn't it be torture for a vampire to clean up blood? The smell of it would drive them insane, right? Well not for Richard. He cleaned up all the spots on the floor. \n\"Are you ready?\" Richard asked us. \n\"I am.\" I said. \n\"Yeah me too.\" Nick said. \n\"Let's go then.\" He said while opening the door. \nWe went outside and got in Richard's red Pontiac G3. I know my cars. That and I saw a commercial about them. Richard drove and Nick sat in the passenger seat. I sat in the back. It was weird having Richard drive. I don't usually go in the car with anyone else but Nick. Even when my dad was alive I always got in the car with Nick driving. I wasn't too sure on how Richard was with his driving. But we didn't crash into anything when we got to the restaurant so I guess he's a good driver. \nWe sat in a booth next to a window like this morning. But this morning I was sitting at a table not a booth. \n\"I'll be back. I never used the bathroom before we left.\" Nick said and limped away. \nI wasn't too sure either about being alone with this guy but he didn't hurt Nick so I think I can trust him. I watched Nick until he wasn't seen anymore. \n\"You know my secret, don't you?\" Richard asked. \n\"Yes. I'm sorry I have been treating you badly. I have been scared lately. I just found about all this yesterday and I am not too sure about all of this.\" \n\"It's okay kid. I knew you were scared today with me at the house. You thought I killed him.\" \n\"Yeah . . .\" I said softly. \n\"Trust me on this. I'm not a guy who wants to kill innocent people.\" He whispered to me. \nI'm glad he said that. I felt much better hearing that come out his mouth. \n\"You're living with Jordan Trent, right?\" He asked me. \n\"Yeah.\" \n\"Good guy, good guy. I use to live with him at that mansion of his.\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"Yes. Those vampires at his mansion. Don't let them get to you. I've been watching you get nervous.\" \nIf I keep this up I'm never going to be able to keep Jordan's secret. \nNick came back over and sat on the side I was sitting on. \"Okay let's order.\" He said picking up the menu. \nI couldn't help but stare at Richard. His bronze eyes and his chocolate brown hair. Why are all these vampires good looking? Wait, so they can draw in their prey. That's why. Just like Sam's beauty. I thought she was beautiful and cute but when she bit me I was deceived. I'm never going to be alone by someone like her again. \nAfter we had dinner Richard drove me to the mansion. It was a little earlier than I said I was going to be coming back but since we were out anyway I minds well just go back. I walked up the steps and Richard was driving away. You think if I ran away they'd come looking for me? No, no I can't do that. I'm just so scared if I open that door one will attack me. But, Richard said Jordan is a good guy so if anything did happen he'd come to the rescue, right? \nThe door opened. The butler was the one who had it open. I shivered. Stupid butler vampire. \n\"Welcome back Miss.\" He said. \nI walked in keeping my distance from him. \"Yeah . . . thanks.\" \nHe shut the door. \n\"Back already.\" \nI looked to my left. Jordan stood there. He really needs to stop the poofing in and out stuff. \n\"Yeah. We went out for dinner so I thought I'd just come back early since we were already out.\" I explained to him. \nHe nodded. \nAn arm went around my shoulder I quickly looked to my right. It was Nile. \n\"You never told me you were going somewhere today.\" Nile said. \n\"Uh - I didn't think it mattered to you.\" I said confused. \n\"You're my new friend of course it matters.\" He smiled showing his sharp teeth. \nFriend? I'm his friend? A vampire having a human friend. He accepted me so fast. That's strange. \n\"What? You don't want to be friends.\" He asked. \n\"What? No, that's not it.\" \n\"Then what?\" \n\"Nothing, nothing.\" \n\"Kiara?\" Jordan said. \n\"Yes?\" \n\"Tomorrow we vampires have to go to a party. It's only for vampires so you're going to have to stay here. Is that alright?\" \nI don't know is that freaky butler leaving. \n\"I can stay with her.\" Nile said. \n\"Are you sure?\" Jordan asked. \n\"Of course. I have to get to know my new human friend.\" He smiled. \n\"Is that alright with you Kiara?\" Jordan asked me. \n\"Yes, that's fine.\" \n\"It will just be the two of you.\" He mentioned. \nOn second thought . . . just the two of us in this big mansion . . . alone . . . with a vampire. Yeah um, now I'm not too sure about that. \n\"She'll be fine.\" Nile said. \"I'm not going to hurt her.\" \n\"It's not you I'm worried about.\" Jordan said. \nNile had a confused look on his face. \n\"Come here.\" Jordan said walking away. \nNile took his arm off of me and walked away with Jordan. I looked over my shoulder. That butler stared at me. I looked back in front of me and kind of walked away slowly over to the stairs. \nI wonder what Jordan is worried about? If he's not worried about Nile. Then who? \nThey came back over. Jordan started to walk up the stairs and Nile stood by my side. \n\"Just watch your back.\" Jordan said walking away. \nAlthough Jordan is the master of this place he dresses just like a regular teenager. Blue shirt, baggy jeans, ears pierced. It's attractive. \nDid I just think that? \n\n\n"

Get up. Don't you want breakfast?\" \nI already know who it was. I didn't bother to look at their face. \n\"How'd you get in my room? I locked it last night.\" I asked Nile \n\"Locking your door isn't going to do anything. I climbed up the balcony.\" \nI couldn't even picture that in my head. How do you climb up to the second floor? \n\"Let's go.\" He said. \nI sat up. \"Are you my new alarm clock or something?\" \n\"Yeah sure.\" \n\"I have to take a shower first. So leave.\" \nHe sighed. \"I'll wait in the hall.\" He said and walked out of my room. \nI got up still tired and went to the bathroom. I turned on the shower to let it get warmed up. My bandage on my hand was still there. I don't really need it anymore. It's been a couple of days. I took the bandage off and the scar of two small holes were still on my wrist. It's not that bad. I'll still live. \nAfter I took a shower and got dressed I opened the door. Nile was leaning against the wall doing something with his phone. A vampire with a phone. Never really seen that one before. \n\"Took you long enough.\" Nile said putting away his phone. \n\"Sorry.\" I said. \n\"Yeah, yeah.\" He said going down the hall. \nI followed behind him. If I try to find the dining room I'd probably end up on the other side of the mansion. I don't know what I would without Nile. \n\"So it's just going to be the two of us today.\" He said. \"The others leave today at 5.\" \n\"You can go to that party. You don't have to stay with me.\" I said. \n\"Actually, I kinda can't go now.\" \n\"Why not?\" \n\"Never mind that.\" \nI know if I start arguing with him he'll just get mad so I should just keep my mouth shut. \nWe got to the dining room where some people were sitting and others were leaving. This place kind of feels like a hotel to me. You know, go get breakfast then leave to go to your room. A guy bumped into me on his way out. We looked at each other. His eyes were dark and looked red. His hair was pitch black. He gave me an evil stare like he was trying to tell me to leave. I could tell he didn't want me here. \nNile grabbed my arm and pulled me away from him. \"You might want to stay away from him.\" He whispered to me. \nI looked behind my shoulder and saw him leave I looked back in front of me. \"Why?\" \n\"He - he doesn't like humans. Just don't make eye contact.\" \nHe said it like he was also afraid of him. \nI sat in the same spot like I did the other day for dinner. It looked like everyone sat in the same place also. The girl with the black long hair still sat next to me on my left side. Jordan sat at the end of the table to my right. \n\"Finally got up?\" Jordan said with his legs up on his chair pulled up against his chest. \n\"Yeah.\" \nHis hair wasn't swept to this side today. It was just down and it was longer. He's so cute with his blonde hair in his eyes. He looked innocent with his baby blue eyes. Yuck, what am I saying? He's a vampire and I'm a human. I will never fall for a blood sucker. \n\"Are you sure you'll be okay with Nile?\" Jordan asked me in a loving tone. \n\"Yes, I'll be fine.\" \nA plate was put in front of me. It was like any other breakfast. I had scrambled eggs, sausage, and toast. \n\"Yesterday,\" I said \"You said you weren't worried about Nile being left here alone with me but someone else.\" \n\"Don't worry about that. If Nile is with you than nothing will happen, got it?\" \n\"Uh - yeah I guess.\" \nI picked up my fork and started eating. Jordan won't tell me who it is. I wonder if it's that guy that left a couple of minutes ago. No, because he would go to the party too. If it's that butler, I'm telling ya I'll kill him if he ever laid a hand on me. Yeah, right. Like I would be able to tackle a vampire to the floor when he moves at the speed of lightning. \nI sighed under my breath. At the corner of my eye I could tell Jordan was staring at me. I didn't look at him. I just stared at my plate. I'm still scared looking at any of these vampires eyes. \n\"Is everything okay?\" Jordan asked me. \nDo you know how many times people have asked me if I was okay? Too many times. \n\"Yes, fine.\" I said finishing whatever was left on my plate. \nJordan rested his head on his knees just staring at me. I felt very uncomfortable and I don't know why. \n\"I see you took your bandage off.\" He said. \n\"Oh, uh yeah. My wrist is fine so I thought I'd just take it off.\" \n\"Kiara!\" Nile yelled from across the room interrupting my conversation with Jordan. \"Come here.\" \nNile wanted me to go over there . . . across the room . . . where all those other vampires are. Um I don't think so. \n\"Come on get up!\" He yelled. \nI had no choice. I got up and walked past the vampires. They all stared as I walked past them. I hated being looked at like I was their dinner. I reached Nile and he put his arm around my shoulder like he knew me forever. \n\"These vampires wanted to meet you.\" Nile said. \nHe can't say people because their technically not people. \n\"This is Gracie.\" He pointed to a girl with medium bleach blonde hair and brown eyes. \"That's Hazel.\" He pointed to a girl with medium brown hair and hazel eyes. \"And that's Austin.\" He pointed to a guy with short dirty blonde hair. \n\"Nice to meet you.\" I said. \n\"Aw, you're so cute.\" Gracie said. \n\"I know isn't she?\" Hazel whispered to her. \n\"Thank you . . .\" I said kind of unsure about that. \nAustin laughed. \"Not too sure about us, huh?\" \nI didn't reply to that. \n\"You'll get use to us.\" Austin said. \n\"Ask us anything if you have questions.\" Gracie said. \n\"We'll be gladly to help.\" Hazel said. \nTheir voices sounded nice and sweet. Like a very soothing sound. They were all so beautiful. Yet I was cute to them. I'm starting to get a little bit of an idea these vampires won't hurt me. But I still have to keep an eye out. \nLater, it was 5 o'clock. The vampires are leaving now. That means it's just going to be Nile and I. Alone. In this big mansion. \nI heard a click and looked over at the door. Nile came walking in. \n\nThis comment may be offensive. \n\n"

I don't remember what happened. \nA cold hand touched my arm. \n\"Oh god, wake up. Jordan is going to kill me if he finds out about this.\" Nile said in a worried tone. \"You gotta wake up kid.\" \nI tried to wrestle myself to get my eyes open. I was in pain and it even hurt trying to open my eyes but I managed to get them open. I was staring at the ceiling which was the ceiling of Nile's room. \nNile breathed out in a deep relief. \"You're okay.\" He said. \nI sat up on the ground. My pounded more and I felt dizzy and shaky. I looked at Nile. He was covered in blood. His shirt was splattered with it, the blood dripped off his face and he looked beat up. I looked behind him and I just broke down in fear. The wall was splattered with blood. It looked like someone just painted it on. I felt something drip down my neck and took my hand to whip it off. It was fresh blood. \nI was ready to scream but Nile took his hand and covered my mouth. \n\"Don't scream.\" He said. \"The smell of blood is strong in here if you scream you'll call every vampire. Especially the ones who work here. It won't be too long that they'll all get the urge to come.\" \nI heard something step on to the carpet floor outside the closed door. Nile took his hand off from me and looked toward the door. We were silent and waited for the person to come in. My eye sight started to get dark and faded. I don't think I can stay up any longer. The smell of the blood was giving me a headache and the blood that I was losing was making me weak. I felt dizzy and just collapsed back down on the floor. \nI woke up in my bedroom. I sat up fast breathing heavy. What happened? \n\"Thank God you're awake.\" Nile said sitting at the table. He was all cleaned and washed up like nothing even happened. \nI rubbed my head. \"What happened?\" \n\"I'll explain later. Jordan is going to be home 10 min with everyone else. Take a shower quickly. We have to get rid of the smell of blood on you.\" \nI looked at my hand which still had the blood on my hand when I whipped my neck off. \nNile grabbed my arm and got me off the bed. He pushed me toward the bathroom. \"Come on hurry up. We don't have much time.\" \nI got in the bathroom and shut the door. Nile had already put clean clothes in the bathroom for me. I looked in the mirror. I looked like a train wreck. There was all this dried up blood on my neck that came on to my shirt. My hair had spots in it. It was all over my jeans and shoes. I looked closer in the mirror and saw two little holes in my neck. Someone bit me. Who bit me? I can't remember. \n\"I don't hear water running!\" Nile yelled. \nI turned on the water and took a quick shower. All the blood washed off. It looked like a fountain of blood washing down the drain. It was getting me sick looking at it. I got dressed and combed my hair real quick. I came out with my clothes and shoes that were basically drenched with blood. \n\"Give me your clothes.\" Nile said. \n\"What are you going to do with them?\" \n\"Burn them.\" \n\"What? You're not going to burn my clothes. I can get the blood stains out.\" \n\"We don't have time for that. The only way the smell will go away is if I burn it.\" \nI hesitated. These are my favorite clothes. \n\"Would you just give them to me! I'll buy you freakin' new ones.\" He said grabbing them from my hand. \nHe disappeared and I was left alone in the room. I got nervous. I went over to the wall so I could see what was around me. I looked up at the ceiling nothing was there. A vampire bit me and I want to know who it was. Nile isn't going to tell me who right away. Jordan will probably find out what happened. There is no way Jordan covered up his room. He would have to change the carpet and wash the walls down. He would have never finished in time. \nNile ended back and front of me. \"Okay so the clothes are gone, everything is washed, and I don't smell blood. I think we're good.\" He said smiling at me. You could tell that he looked worried. Nile got up close to my neck. \"You might want to keep that covered with your hair.\" He said. \nI put my hair around the place where I got bit. \"I don't even remember it happening.\" I told him. \n\"I know you don't. You got knocked out.\" \n\"By who?\" \nNile looked at the clock that hung up on the wall. \"It's a minute before 10.\" \nA minute before 10! How long have I been out of it? \nNile picked me up and we ended up in a different room. He set me back down. \nIt's like when he moves it's in a blink of an eye. I wish I had that power when I ran for gym at school. \n\"Watch TV and act casual.\" He told me. \nI looked around the room. The room doesn't seem old fashion like the down stairs does. The couch and chairs were black leather. There was a flat screen in front of the couch. There was a pool table to the right of me and to the left was a CD/DVD rack. It filled all the shelves on it. It was just an ordinary room. I went over to the couch and sat down Nile stood at the door way looking down the hall for some reason. \nI reached for the remote that was on the glass coffee table. When I did I saw a case. 'Call of Duty.' I laughed to myself. That's a war game. I never heard of vampires playing war games. Especially when the blood pops up on the screen when you're injured. I know this because Nick plays it sometimes when I go over to his house. He's obsessed with it. \nI turned on the TV. The first thing that was on was Twilight. That vampire movie. No, I've had enough of vampires, thank you very much. I changed the channel. Vampire Dairies. What? No, I don't want to watch vampires. I changed the channel. Underworld. That's about vampires too. I kept flipping through the channels. Fright Night, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Forsaken. What the heck? Are these all vampire movies. \n\"Hey Nile. What's up with these movies? They're all about vampires.\" I said still flipping through the channel. \nHe grabbed the remote from me and pressed a button. It went to a different channel. He started flipping through it. MTV, Stars, Teen Nick. He handed it back to me. \n\"Thanks.\" I said. \nNile went back to the door looking down the hall. \n\"What are you doing?\" I asked. \nThere was a faint echo of a door slamming. \n\"They're back.\" He came over and hopped over the couch and sat down like that's what he was doing for hours. \"Don't mention any of this, got it?\" \n\"Yeah.\" I put the channel on Stars which was playing The Dark Knight. That's something a vampire would watch right? \nI felt the presents of a vampire enter the room. \n\"Hey you two.\" Jordan said. He came over behind the couch. \"Is this what you guys have been doing all night?\" \nNile and I looked at each other. \n\"Yeah.\" Nile said. \"How was the party?\" He asked changing the subject. \n\"It was pleasant.\" Jordan glared at me and Nile. \nI felt like he already knew what happened. \n\"I'm going to get some rest.\" He turned around and started heading out the door. \"Have fun you two.\" \nI looked at Nile. He had the same worried expression I do. \n\"Put in the Call of Duty!\" I heard some guy say out in the hall. \nNile and I turned around looking over the couch. 5 guys came in the room. They all had dark hair and light eyes. They look like a clique. One of the vampires ended up next to me and took the remote out of my hand. \n\"I'm changing the channel human.\" He said. \nI let him do whatever. I wasn't going to argue with some guy like him. His muscles were huge like he could snap my neck in second. I flinched at the thought of it. \nAll the other guys came over and popped in the game. I got off the couch to make room for the blood suckers. I wasn't watching were I was going and bumped into one of them. \n\"Sorry.\" I said. \n\"It's okay.\" The boy smiled. \nAw, he was so cute. He had this little baby face. His hair was light straight brown hair that came down to eyebrows and his eyes were a green color. His smile was cute. \n\"I'm Colin.\" He said. \n\"Nice to meet you Colin.\" \n\"Do you want to stay?\" He asked me. \n\"Uh . . .\" I looked behind my shoulder. Some were staring at me as their game loaded. \"I don't think that's a good idea.\" I said to Colin. \n\"Of course it is. You're welcome to stay here.\" He said smiling at me. \nHow can I resist that smile of his? \n\"I - I guess I could stay.\" \n\"Good.\" He said still smiling and went over toward everyone else. \nI sat down in one of the leather chairs and watched. They were all getting excited about to win then got so angry that they lost. Pathetic. I'm so tired. I don't have a lot of energy right now. Not since my blood was basically drained out of me. \nI got comfortable on the chair and fell asleep. \nI was sound asleep and I felt someone pick me up. I didn't open my eyes. I was too tired to even do that much. I was placed in a bed which I was guessing it was mine because I felt the fussy blanket that was on top. A blanket was put over me then a cold hand touched my neck. It was the side I got bit on. \n\"Idiot.\" I heard them whisper. \"You always get yourself in trouble.\" \nAfter they talked it finally clicked in my head who it was. \nThe cold hand moved off from my neck and I heard them walking away. I turned over and looked at them about to shut the door. It was Jordan. The door shut behind him. \nThe secret is up already. He knows what happened. I still don't know who bit me but I have a feeling that I'll find out soon. \n\n\n"

Today is Monday. Today was suppose to be my first day of public school but I guess that didn't work out. Everyone will probably wonder what happened to me. I never did tell Nick Jordan is making me be homeschooled. I guess he'll find out next time I see him. \n\"School starts at 12.\" He said. \n\"12?\" I asked. \n\"Yeah, Jordan thought you might want to sleep in and have school at 12.\" \nI sat up. I wonder if Nile knows that Jordan found out. I'm tempted to ask him but then again maybe I should keep it to myself. \n\"It's funny.\" Nile said. \"You're the only one who's being homeschooled.\" \n\"Huh?\" \n\"Yeah, we vampires live for a long time so we stop taking school.\" \n\"Lucky.\" I whispered. \"So I'm going to be the only one.\" \n\"Yep.\" \nI sighed. \"I still don't understand why I can't go to public school.\" \n\"Actually, Jordan was talking to me about that. But he's not too sure about it.\" \nI hope he says I can. \n\"Well, get ready to get to your new class room.\" Nile said sarcastic and left my room. \nI plopped back down laying on my bed. So much has happened these few days. I would actually like to go to public school to get away from here. I don't feel like getting my blood taken away again. I - I could stay with Nick. But that would mean I didn't do the last request my father told me to do. But then again, I am staying here now and my father didn't say I have to live here forever. What am I saying? I'm twisting his words. Why'd you have to get yourself killed in a car accident? I have to take a shower. \nI got up and went to the bathroom. I looked in the mirror. My hair was all knotted and sticking up in places. I moved my hair away from my neck to see the mark. They look red today. It's probably nothing. \nAfter my nice hot shower I came out of my bedroom. Nile sat on the ground waiting for me. I feel like he's my little dog but I'm the one following him. \n\"Do I need notebooks or pencils?\" I asked. \nNile stood up. \"No. Jordan has all that stuff.\" \nI guess I bought all my school supplies for nothing. \n\"It's down this way.\" He pointed to the left then started to walk. \nWhere were going was to the left of the staircase. Which I have not gone down yet. I'm afraid to. There is usually a surprise for me in each room. We walked down the left hall then took a right. We didn't go down too far. The door was half way down the hall. The door had a little window where you could peek in. Nile opened the door. I looked around him. It was a . . . library? Strange. This place has everything in it. \n\"This is where you'll have your classes.\" He said. \nThere was a table with one chair and a white board in front of the table. \n\"I'll feel so lonely.\" I told Nile. \nHe laughed. \"Don't worry I'll come visit you. Good luck with class.\" He said and walked away. \n\"Wait. Who's teaching me?\" I asked as he walked away. \n\"Some lady. She'll be there in a minute.\" \nI went in the library and sat at the table. This place is kind of cozy. I don't know why but it has brightness to it or something. So, some lady is coming. That doesn't really give me a lot of information about her. \nBefore I thought anything else there was a big slam and a lady ended up in front of me. \nGosh, what an entrance. \n\"I am your new teacher. Miss. Gale.\" She said with a stern voice. \nShe looked old but she was a vampire. She had short brown hair and brown looking eyes. \n\"I'm Kiara Hatake.\" I said. \n\"I know who you are.\" She said snobby. \nWhoa, who bit her on the wrong day? \nShe slid the books that she slammed on the table over to me. \"This is all you'll need this year.\" \nIt was just 2, 3 subject notebooks, 3 text books and it looked like 2 paces at the bottom. She put a pencil on top. \n\"We will start with math.\" She said taking a marker and writing something on the board. She wrote out this long equation. \"Do that.\" \nI stared at the board. I don't know how to do that. This looks too complicated than what I have been learning. \n\"Is something wrong?\" She asked. \n\"Uh - I don't know what to do.\" \nShe sighed. \"First you take this number and you have to make it go through the parentheses. After you do that you have to do it to the other side. Then take your like terms and subtract or add according to your signs.\" \nWhat is this lady talking about? I have no clue what she's doing. \n\"Do you get it?\" She asked. \n\"Uh huh.\" I lied. \n\"Okay next step . . .\" \nWait go back I don't even get the first part . . . Ugh; this is going to be a long day. \nSo, throughout the day this lady over here kept confusing me. Especially in history. She would be talking about a president then switch her story over to vampire history. I am human so shouldn't I learn about human people not vampires. Later, I've gone through 3 different classes. Mrs. Gale told me to get lunch. Even though it was 2 o'clock. I haven't had breakfast so I'm starving. \nI got up from the table and opened the door. Nile was in the hall sitting on the ground. \n\"How long have you been here?\" I asked. \n\"About 15 min. This is when I use to get out of class to eat lunch.\" He stood up. \"Let's go find something in the kitchen for ya.\" He said walking down the hall. \nWhen we got down stairs we were about to go to the kitchen which was over by the dining room, but there was a knock on the door. Nile stopped and I stopped behind him. The butler opened up the door. \n\"Mr. Hird.\" The butler said. \nI looked at the person who was standing in the door way. A guy. No older than 19. He had black hair that fell down over his eyes. His hair looked thin and shaggy. He dressed like a normal teenager would. His eyes . . . they were a beautiful blue color. That's the first thing you noticed when you look at him. His blue eyes. \n\"Drake.\" Jordan said appearing in front of him. \"I wasn't expecting you.\" \n\"I was around the area and I thought I would drop by.\" Drake said. \n\"Come in.\" Jordan said. \nDrake came in and the first thing he did was stare right at me. I moved over hiding behind Nile. \n\"How are things going?\" Jordan asked. \n\"Very well actually.\" \n\"Drake.\" Someone said. \nI turned my head. It was that guy from yesterday. The one with dark hair and eyes from breakfast. The one that Nile said he didn't like humans. \n\"Dominic.\" Drake said. \nI looked at both of them. They look so much alike. \nDominic walked over to him and gave him a hug. \n\"I haven't seen you in a long time brother.\" Dominic said. \nOh, so they're brothers. \n\"Yes, it has been a while.\" Drake replied. \n\"Hey,\" Nile whispered to me. \"I think we should go.\" \nI think Nile is right. If Dominic doesn't like me. I don't want to know how Drake would feel about me. \nI started to walk behind Nile. \n\"Who is this?\" Drake said ending up in front of me. \n\"Uh - Kiara Hatake sir.\" \nHe got his face kind of close to mine and breathed in like he was taking in the scent of me. \n\"I'm Drake Hird.\" He said. \nI was getting lost in his eyes. The blueness of his eyes are like hypnotizing me. \n\"Let's go Kiara.\" Nile said pulling me away from him. \n\"Nice to meet you.\" I said being dragged away by Nile. \nAs soon as we were far enough for Drake not to hear me I started talking to Nile. \n\"Why were you pulling me away from him?\" I asked Nile. \n\"Just ignore that guy. He's bad news just like his brother. I'm warning you. Never be alone with either of them.\" \nI couldn't imagine what would happen if I was stuck in a room with those guys and I really don't want to find out. \n\"He'll probably stay the night here so just keep an eye out for him.\" \nI kept quiet after he told me that. I've already been bitten twice since I have been here. I really don't want to be bitten again. I still don't have all my energy yet from losing so much blood. If I lost blood like I did yesterday I'd probably die. I still don't understand why my father placed me here. Did he know what these people were? If he did, why did he let me stay here? \nAfter I got something to eat from the kitchen I went back upstairs in the library. Mrs. Gale left me to read for literature class. She just picked a book off the shelf and gave it to me. She left me . . . alone. Oh well, I'm glad I'm not being stared at as I read. \nI felt someone watching me as soon as I thought that. I turned to my right and in the window I saw a shadow in the hall then it disappeared. \nI stand corrected. I am being stared at. I feel like I can't do anything without being watched by vampires. Vampires . . . what a joke. And why do vampires drink blood anyway? What's so fun about drinking human blood? Just thinking about it gets me sick. Whatever, I'm going to have to live with it either way. There's no way I'm going to get myself out of this one. I chose to live here and now I can't leave. Well, I could but I'd probably just be brought back here. If I know their secret they're not going to let me go. Jordan said when I first came here, if I told anyone he'd turn me into one of them. I would hate to drink blood and have that urge to. No thanks. I'll stay human. \n\nThis comment may be offensive. \n\n"

I looked at the clock. It's 12:43. Gosh, I can't fall asleep. I've been lying here for 2 hours straight. But, it feels a lot shorter than that. I always do my hard thinking before I fall asleep or in the shower. That's the way I am. But the only thing that has been going through my mind is vampires. That's the only thing I can think about and it's bothering me. \nI turned over to my left side facing the door. I can see the hall light shine through the crack of the door. I was staring at the light but then I saw a shadow behind the door. Must be one of the vampires doing something. They don't usually sleep at night. I think . . . I wouldn't really know. The shadow stayed there for a long period of time. I got a little nervous thinking it was Drake. Nile told me never to be alone with him or Dominic. But, what if I was forced to. That would be a whole different story. \n\"That door is off limits.\" I heard someone say behind the door. \nThe shadow moved. \n\"I wasn't going to do anything.\" The other said. \nI got up from my bed quietly and made my way toward the door. I wanted to get closer so I could hear who it was. \n\"I'm warning you, you stay away from her.\" \nI think - I think its Jordan. \n\"Why do you have a human living with you? Do you know what would happen if the others found out?\" \nThat must be Drake. I can tell from his firm voice. \n\"I know exactly what would happen if they found out. I'm not planning for that to happen. Even if they did I think I can cooperate with them.\" Jordan said. \"You may want to go back to your room now.\" \nThere was silence and I looked down to the floor. The shadow left. I waited a couple of more seconds and was going to go hop back in my bed but the door all of a sudden opened up on me and I got hit in the head. \nOw. I rubbed my head and moved away from the door. Jordan stood half way in my room looking at me. \n\"Idiot. What are you doing?\" He rubbed my forehead. \"Go back to bed.\" \n\"I uh - . . . Okay.\" \n\"Goodnight.\" He said. \n\"Night.\" \nHe closed the door. \nWhat was that all about? Talk about not sleeping 5 min ago, now I'm really not going to fall asleep. It's a good thing my class starts at noon. Jordan is a mystery to me. I don't know a lot about him. He keeps things to himself. He has this lost look on his face all the time. When he looks at me, I can't tell if he feels sad or happy. \nI was in my last class for the day trying to stay awake. I fell asleep at like two and you'd think I'd get enough sleep if I slept till eleven but I really didn't. Staying awake in class is harder than you think. And when there is just me in class I have to make sure I'm paying attention. Mrs. Gale will tell me to answer a question and if I just sit there staring in thin air not listening to her she's going to get angry. I do not want to know how a vampire teacher reacts when they get angry. \n\"I want you to do this for homework tonight, okay?\" Mrs. Gale said. \n\"Yes.\" \n\"Class is dismissed.\" \nMrs. Gale disappeared in a flash. I picked up my books and went in the hall. Nile wasn't there. That's strange . . . He's usually right here waiting for me. I don't know maybe he's doing something. He doesn't always have to be with me. He could have just gotten sick of me and decided to stay in his room. I can find my way back to my room from here. \nI started walking down the hall then I tripped and fell on the ground with my books and papers going everywhere. What the heck did I trip on? I looked back around to see what I tripped on. Nothing. Like they say 'it takes skill to trip on flat surfaces.' I sat on the ground staring at everything that was spread out on the floor. I'm too lazy to pick it up. As I stared at the stuff I saw a feet standing at the end of the stuff. I was thinking it was Nile but I don't ever remember him wearing those shoes. I looked up. No, it wasn't Nile. It was Drake. The one who Nile said to not be alone with. Here I am, in the hall way, alone, with him. \n\"Are you doing your homework in the hall?\" He asked. \n\"Uh - No, I tripped.\" I said starting to pick my papers up. \n\"Let me help you.\" He said kneeling and picking things up. \nI wasn't going to refuse his generosity. He handed me the stuff that he picked up. \n\"Thanks.\" I said trying not to look him in the eye. \n\"No problem.\" \nI stood up. I went around him to go to my room. \n\"What's the rush?\" He asked. \nI turned around to him. \"Nothing. I'm - tired and I thought I'd take a nap.\" \nDrake ended up in front of me and placed a hand on my face. \"Why are you here?\" He asked me taking his fingers going down my face. \nI froze in place. This was very uncomfortable. This feels strange. What am I suppose to do? Nile isn't here to save me. If I even tried to run away I'd probably be tackled to the ground. \n\"Aren't you afraid?\" He asked. \nI looked away not looking him in the face. I heard a slap sound; Drake's hand was off me. I looked over. Jordan slapped his hand away. He came to the rescue just in time. \n\"I think it's time for you to leave.\" Jordan said. \nDrake and Jordan glared at each other. I felt like they wanted to fight right in front of me. Drake looked at me and walked away. Jordan walked with me the other day. We were far enough so that he couldn't hear us. \n\"Thanks.\" I told Jordan. \nHe had a gentle expression. \"You could have walked away.\" He told me. \n\"I was, scared to.\" \n\"You have to be more cautioned around him . . . . I made up my mind.\" He said. \"I decided that you can go to public school.\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"I think you'd be safer there than here. Other vampires, such as Drake, come here to visit. I think it would be best for you to stay at public school than here with other vampires coming in and out. The time you come back from school they won't be here.\" \n\"Are you sure that it's fine?\" \n\"I'm sure. You'll be starting tomorrow morning.\" \nThat means I won't be sleeping in till eleven anymore. \n\"But, there is one condition.\" Jordan said. \n\"What's that?\" \n\"Nile is attending school with you.\" \n\"Uh - are you sure that's such a good idea?\" \n\"Positive. He did resist himself from your blood on Sunday.\" \nShout, now I really know that he found out. \nWe stopped in front of my room. \n\"How - did you find out?\" I asked. \n\"It was pretty obvious. I saw your neck as soon as I came in the room. I'm not an idiot. You can't hide anything from me.\" \n\"Do, you know who did it?\" \nHe shook his head. \"I asked Nile. He didn't know who did it.\" \nSo, Nile does know that Jordan found out. He didn't tell me he found out! But, how does Nile not know who it was? Whose blood was all over the wall? Oh God, I hope it wasn't mine. \n\"We'll be keeping a better eye on you. You won't go anywhere alone. Even when you're with Nick.\" \nWhat?! I can't even go to Nick's house without being watched. I don't want a vampire watching me 24/7. I want some privacy ya know. Well, I would rather have a vampire I know that's good watching me than a bad one. But that's beside the point. \n\"Go do take a nap or something. You look exhausted.\" He said walking down the hall. \nI don't have to do this homework Mrs. Gale gave me because I'm going to public school. I can take a nice long nap. That sounds good. \nI walked in my room and locked the door. \n\"We get to go to public school tomorrow.\" \nI jumped and turned to my right. Nile sat on the couch lying down. \n\"Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.\" He said staring at the ceiling. \nI wonder if he knows what just happened down the hall. Probably if he's in my room waiting for me. \n\"Yeah, exciting.\" I said placing all my stuff on the table. \"What do I do with all this stuff then?\" \n\"Just leave it there. I'll get it later.\" \nNile sounds . . . down. He hasn't really been acting himself since Sunday. I liked the obnoxious person who made stupid remarks. I don't know what's gotten in to him. \nI walked over behind the couch and looked down at him. He always wears these cloth winter hats. One day it's black the other it's white then it's gray. I don't really care if he wears them. It fits him actually. \nHe looked at me. \"What?\" \n\"Nothing. You just seem down.\" \n\"Oh, sorry.\" He looked back at the ceiling. \"I've just been thinking a lot, that's all.\" \nI didn't say anything. I went over to my bed and laid down. \n\"What are you doing?\" He asked. \n\"Taking a nap. You're welcome to leave.\" \n\"Nah, that's okay. I'll stay here. I have nothing else to do today.\" \nI was hoping he'd say 'okay I'll see you later.' Guess not. I don't mind. I trust Nile. Jordan and Nile are actually the only two I really trust. I can't trust Austin, Gracie, or Hazel yet. I don't know them too well. But, I think they'll be fine. If they wanted to meet me they can't hate humans. Then Colin. Well, he seems like a nice guy. Every time he'd say something to me it would always be with a smile. Then there is that little demanded girl Sam. I can't trust her at all. Not ever since she bit me on the wrist. Drake and Dominic I really can't trust. Both Jordan and Nile are weary about those two. It's like whenever they are near me I'm pulled away. If they are so dangerous why are they here? Better yet, why am I here? \n\n\n"

Get up.\" \nThere's that rudeness like when I first met him. \nI sat up. I'm still tired and all I want to do is sleep. \n\"If you sleep too long you're not going to be able to fall asleep tonight.\" He added. \nI got off the bed. \nNile cocked his head at me. \n\"What?\" I asked. \nHe moved my hair away from my neck. \"Hey has - has that been hurting at all?

Drake was eating with us tonight. He sat next to his brother. He wasn't too far away from where I sit. Probably 6 chairs down on the other side of me. I sat down at the table between Katie and Jordan like I always do. Nile sits down at the other end with Austin, Gracie, and Hazel. I don't know if these are assigned seats or if everyone just really sits in the same place every day. \nJordan was staring at me. I looked over and stared back at him. \n\"What?\" I asked. \n\"Turn your head that way.\" He pointed to my right. \nI turned my head to the right. \n\"Come with me.\" He said standing up. \n\"Why?\" \n\"Do as you're told.\" \nI stood up and went to go follow him. He stopped. \n\"Nile!\" He yelled. Nile looked up to him and Jordan was moving his hand back and forth to tell him to come with. \nNile got up and ran over to us. \n\"Yes?\" Nile said. \n\"Follow me.\" He said. \nNile looked at me trying to say what is this about with his eyes and all I did was shrug at him. Nile and I followed Jordan to a door and we went inside. It was an office. There were book shelves on each side of the wall and the desk in the middle of the room. It was old fashioned like the living room. \n\"What's this about?\" Nile asked. \nJordan grabbed a hold of my chin and moved my head to the side looking at my neck. \"Do you understand who bit her?\" Jordan asked Nile. \nHe thought about it. \n\"The only one who can do this are those born from the Caliber tribe.\" \nNile realized something. \"You don't think . . .\" \nJordan nodded. \"Those are the only two who are from that tribe.\" He let go of me and went over to the desk. He took a key out of his pocket and unlocked the desk drawer. He got out a little long box and took something out of it. \n\"You're going to give it to her?\" Nile asked. \nHe nodded. \"I think she'll be able to handle it.\" \n\"Are you sure about that?\" \nJordan came over to me with a shot in his hand. \"Give me your arm.\" \n\"What are you going to give me?\" I said nervous. \n\"It's just a shot to make the bite not get infected.\" \nSam's bite didn't get infected when she bit me. So why is the one on my neck going to get infected? \n\"It's not poison is it?\" I asked. \n\"No, why would I ever give you poison? Don't you think if I wanted to kill you, I would do it already?\" \nIt's true. If he wanted to do it I'd be dead the first day. \nI put my arm out to him and he put the needle in my skin. The liquid in the tube was now put in my blood stream. I don't know what it is but I don't even wanna think about it. \n\"That should do.\" He took the needle out. \n\"How many you got of those?\" Nile asked. \n\"About 3 left. But, I can always get some more.\" Jordan answered while taking care of the needle and the box that it came in. \n\"I thought those were rare.\" \n\"They are. I know some people who have some. If I don't have any I'll get some more.\" He locked the drawer back up. \"We should go back before someone gets suspicious.\" \nWe went back to the dining room and I felt like half of the vampires were staring at me. I felt a little bit better when Nile and Jordan walked with me though. I sat back down in my seat. The plate of food was already in front of me. But for some reason I didn't have much of an appetite. I feel so tired and I don't know why. I took a nap and I still feel exhausted. What's up with me lately? I can't even go back to my room. I can't find it. I've been through these halls at least 10 times since I've been here and I still don't know how to get to my room. \n\"Aren't you going to eat?\" Jordan asked. \n\"I'm - not really hungry.\" \nHe nodded. \"You can leave to your room if you want.\" \n\"I can't. I'll get lost.\" \nHe chuckled. \"Go sit next to Nile if you want to. You'll be able to get to know the others.\" \n\"Uh, okay.\" I got up and walked over to Nile. I stood behind his chair. He didn't turn around he just looked up to me. \n\"What's up?\" He asked. \n\"Nothing.\" I said. \n\"Aren't you gonna eat?\" \n\"No. I don't feel like eating now.\" \nHe had this look on his face that I can't really explain. It looked like, I don't know, he found something out. I sat down next to him and I listened into the vampires conversations with each other. \nNext day Nile woke me up at 6:30. School starts at 7:30 which sucks. I hate school in the morning. I'm not really a morning person. I got my notebooks and stuff that I bought for school. I left the ones that I used for the homeschooling on the table. It has other information in it. I can rip it out but I'll use it those for something else. I'll just use mine first. \nNile and I went down stairs and were about to go outside to the back. Nile said his car was in the garage so we have to go around back. \n\"Leaving?\" Jordan said. \nWe turned around. \n\"Yeah.\" Nile said. \"We'll be back around two.\" \nJordan nodded and Nile and I went outside. We went around back. You could so tell the house was small outside but as soon as you got inside it was like 40 houses put together. When we got in the back there was a drive way that led out back around the front. Nile opened the garage door. The lights came on one at a time down the room. There garage is more like a ware house. Each vampire had a car. Car after car down the room. We walked down the middle of the cars. Probably 7 cars to the right was Nile's. It was a blue Hybrid truck. I got in the passenger seat and Nile drove. \nI've never been in the car with Nile driving before. Scary . . . \nWe didn't really talk about anything on our way to school. We just kept to ourselves the whole ride. Nile parked the car in the school parking lot. I was kind of scared today about school. Today is my first day. But, I'm with Nile so that gives me a little more comfort. \nAs I got out of the car I looked around at all the people. Some were just standing around by their cars; others were just walking in to school. I'll actually be able to meet real human people! No offence to Nile or anything. He's a good guy but I'd like to get along with humans than vampires. \n\"You ready?\" Nile said. \n\"Yeah.\" \nHe went ahead of me and I followed behind. I tried to stay close because all the kids around me were pushing. It's amazing how everyone looks different from each other. There are so many people in the world yet not one has the same face and even if they were twins they still have a different personality. \n\"Kiara!\" \nI looked over. Someone came running up and hugged me. \n\"I got grounded and I couldn't use my phone or computer to contact you. Why weren't you in school Monday and Tuesday?\" \nIt wasn't a someone. It was Shelby. My friend. \nShe let go of me and looked me in the face. \n\"Oh uh I got sick and couldn't come in.\" I said making it up. \n\"That's not fair. You missed two days of school.\" She looked over to her right. \"Who's that?\" She whispered to me looking at Nile who was waiting for me. \n\"Oh, this is Nile. Nile this is Shelby my friend.\" I said. \n\"Where did you meet him?\" She whispered. \n\"Um, long story.\" \n\"Well, nice to meet you.\" Shelby said to Nile. \n\"Nice to meet you to.\" \n\"He's cute.\" She whispered to me that not even Nile could hear. \nOh gosh, don't fall for him Shelby. He's a blood sucker. Do you really want to kiss someone who has drank blood from another person? I don't think so. You won't ever be around him if you knew the truth. \n\"Class is going to start.\" Nile said. \nI started walking with Nile and Shelby came with us. \n\"What class do you have first?\" I asked Shelby. \n\"History. You?\" \n\"Literature with Nile.\" \n\"I guess we don't have first period together.\" \nI wasn't really watching where I was going and hit someone cold. I got a chill and looked at the person. \nThat can't be possible. Pale skin. I didn't know other vampires went to school to. This guy had golden short hair. It was kind of spiky looking but I think it was natural. His eyes were brown. He was muscular and looked mean. That's a person you definitely don't want to get angry. \n\"Sorry.\" I said. \nThe person looked over at Nile and back at me. I think he knew that Nile was friends with me. The guy didn't say anything and kept going. \n\"Who's that?\" I asked Shelby. \n\"That's Ben Porter. He just moved here. To me he's kind of creepy.\" \n\"Uh - yeah.\" I looked over at Nile. \nNile didn't have a surprise look on his face. I think he already knew it was coming. I think I am realizing more vampires in my life than I ever have. \n\n\n"

School was normal. Nothing really odd about today. I noticed that guy Ben was in one of my classes. I tried not staring at him but I couldn't help it. I have never realized how many vampires there are. I could have known some when I was little and never even realized it. \nIt was the end of the day and Nile and I were walking in the halls to go to his truck. Shelby said she would call me tonight sense her grounding ended today. I was walking behind Nile and then I was pulled into a class room. Literally, pulled into a class room by someone. I was facing the window and I heard the door shut behind me. I didn't really want to turn around to find out who it was. But, if this was some pervert I would have to be ready for whatever. \nI turned around. Ben locked the door. I am trapped in a room with a vampire. I don't know this guy is use to humans. What if I'm his first victim? He could bite me any second and if he does I might not live. I lost a lot of blood last time. \n\"Who are you?\" He asked. \n\"I'm Kiara.\" \n\"Why are you with him?\" \n\"With who?\" \n\"That guy. Nile. Do you know?\" \n\"Know about the - blood sucking. Yeah, yeah I know.\" \nHe ended up in front of me. \"Why? How do you know?\" \n\"Why do you want to know?\" \nHe grabbed both sides of me with his strong hands. \"This is no time for joking. Did he tell you about it?\" \n\"I'm not telling you. It's none of your business.\" \nHe pushed me in to the desk. \nI'm scared now. What's wrong with him? Why does he care how I found out? Where the hell is Nile? Hasn't he noticed I'm gone? I've been taken to a room by a vampire! What the hell is Nile doing? I don't think I'm safer at school than I am at the mansion. I'm still stuck with vampires everywhere I look. \n\"You've been bitten.\" He said looking at my neck. \nI covered it up. \"What's it matter to you?\" \n\"Did that guy do it to you?\" \n\"I'm not telling you anything!\" \nI heard a slam and Nile stood in the door way with a bat in his hand. \n\"What the hell do you think you're doing?\" Nile said. \nI don't know if he was talking to me or Ben. \n\"What's up with the bat? Can't defend yourself.\" Ben said. \n\"I stole it from the baseball team.\" \nHe stole it from the baseball team? Yeah, Nile is definitely different from the other vampires. \n\"Let's go Kiara.\" Nile said. \nI walked around Ben over to Nile. \n\"I wasn't going to hurt her.\" Ben said leaning against the table. \nThat's what they all say until they draw you in then suck your blood. \n\"You come near her again and you're going to wish you never existed.\" Nile threatened. \nBen never said anything back. \n\"Let's go.\" Nile said grabbing my arm and pulled me away. \nI felt relief that Nile came. But, what the heck took him so long? Did he have to steal the bat before he came looking for me? \n\"Literally, what's up with the bat?\" I asked. \n\"If he took his teeth and put them in your neck I would have beat the hell out of him with this.\" \nAs we started to walk out of the school Nile put the bat down at the entrance way. He still had a hold of my arm until we got to the car. I felt nervous because I could tell he was angry. It scared me a little because I still don't really know how he is when he gets angry. \nNile drove back to the mansion. We didn't say anything to each other. Nile let me out of the car before he drove around the back to put his car back in the garage. I got to the door and the butler had it opened. For some reason the butler had darker eyes. I ignored it and went toward the stairs. I didn't want to say hi to anyone. I just wanted to go in my room and shut myself in there. I'm sick of having to deal with these vampires. It's either at school, Nick's house, or here. I can't escape from them. They're just everywhere. I want to leave. \n\"How was school?\" Jordan asked standing at the top of the stairs as I went up. \n\"I don't want to talk about it.\" I said passing him to get to my room. \n\"Uh - okay.\" Jordan said confused. \nI heard a slam as I walked to my room. It must have been Nile coming in. \n\"How was school?\" Jordan asked. \n\"I don't want to talk about it.\" He said. \nI went in my room and shut the door. I locked my door and threw my bag on the ground. I don't feel like doing my homework. I went over to my bed and laid down. \nI've been feeling so weak lately. I haven't been getting much sleep, I'm not much for food anymore, and I've been really lazy. What's been up with me? Is it because from Sunday? I was really scared that day and I haven't been able to do a lot since then. \nI rubbed my neck and felt something wet. I looked at my hand. Blood? I got up and went to the bathroom to look at my neck. It was blood. Blood? Why am I bleeding? It dripped down on to my clothing. I got a cloth and wetted it and squeezed out the water. I put it to my neck and held it there. If I hold it there maybe the blood will stop. \nI waited at least a minute and took the cloth off. The blood kept flowing out. It was coming out of the two holes from my neck. What the heck? It won't stop bleeding. \n\n\n"

It kept flowing out of my neck and I don't know why. I'm getting a little nervous that I'll bleed to death. I don't want to go out and get Jordan or Nile. What if Drake comes after me? What if he's not use to human blood? I'm scared. \nI heard a knock. \n\"Hey Kiara. Are you okay in there?\" Jordan said. \nDo I tell him? \nI walked out in to my room and went to the door and unlocked it. I opened the door and Jordan stood there. \n\"What are you doing?\" He asked looking at my neck. \nI shook my head trying not to cry because I felt like I was going to die. \"I don't know.\" \nHe came in the room and shut the door then locked it. He moved close to me. \n\"Move your hand.\" He said. \nI took my hand off my neck. My hand was all bloody and I felt shaky. Was I really going to bleed to death like this? \n\"Did you do anything to it?\" He asked me. \nI shook my head. \n\"Keep putting pressure on it.\" \nI took the cloth and put pressure on my neck. This is awkward having a vampire stand in front of me while my neck was bleeding. \nHe took his cell phone out and called someone. \n\"Hey, do you think you could come over here?\" Jordan said to someone. \nWho's he calling? \n\"Okay, okay. Thanks.\" He hung up. Jordan looked back at me. \"Someone is going to come and help you. You have nothing to worry about.\" \nI felt worried and I will be no matter how many times this guy tells me not to worry. \nThere was a knock on the door. \n\"Hey, Jordan are you in there?\" Nile said. \nJordan unlocked the door and opened it up. Nile looked at me then back at Jordan. \n\"What's going on?\" Nile asked. \nJordan pulled Nile in and shut and relocked the door. \n\"Why is she bleeding?\" He asked. \nJordan looked at me. \"Uh - tell you later.\" \nWhat?! No. No. If this has to deal with me. He's going to say it right here in front of my face! \nI would say that but I'm really weak to even start yelling at him. My eye sight started getting blurry but I tried to manage with it. I still felt shaky which was bad because I'll just faint if I don't sit down. I felt so weak I couldn't make it over to the bed so I just sat on the ground where I was. \n\"This doesn't look good.\" Jordan said. \n\"What do we do?\" Nile asked. \n\"Eric Mathews is coming over. Hopefully he hurries up.\" \nWho's Eric Mathews? Is he a vampire too? Probably. I can't keep my eyes open. I just feel like fainting. \nNile bent down and put his face close to me. \"Hey, you don't look to good. Are you going to be alright?\" \nI felt dizzy and blacked out. \nI woke up sitting in one of those hospital beds. I had tubes to my arm with blood flowing through it. I was having blood put into me? That's kind of . . . sickening. Just the thought of someone else's blood put into my blood stream just makes me want to get sick. \n\"Kiara?\" \nI looked over. Nile sat in one of the chairs on the left side of the room. \n\"I'm glad you're okay. You lost a lot of blood.\" He said. \nI tried to remember what happened. Oh yeah, my neck was bleeding and I fainted. \n\"You'll be able to leave the hospital in a couple of hours.\" Nile added. \n\"What exactly happened?\" I asked. \n\"You fainted and you were still losing blood. Mr. Mathews came not too long after you fainted. We're at one a vampire hospital.\" \nVampire hospital? Vampire hospital . . . \n\"Does that mean, everyone who works here are vampires?\" I asked. \nHe nodded. \"Humans who were bitten by a vampire or injured by one, come here also. We wouldn't be able to send you to a regular one because they wouldn't know what was on your neck. We can't risk the chances.\" \n\"Where's Jordan?\" I asked. \n\"Talking to Mr. Mathews out in the lobby.\" \n\"Uh - what time is it?\" \n\"About 8 PM.\" \nI've been asleep that whole time! I must have really lost a lot of blood. \n\"I don't think you'll be going to school tomorrow.\" He said changing the subject. \n\"Why?\" \n\"Look at you. You're weak; you can't go to school like that.\" \nHe's right. If I went to school like this people might think I got beat up after school or something. \n\"Jordan wants you to go to Nick's house tomorrow.\" He said. \n\"Nick's house? Why?\" \nHe shrugged. \"I guess Drake will be staying one last night Thursday to Friday. Jordan wants you to go over to Nick's till Sunday night. Just to rest up and get away from us vampires for a little.\" \nFour days without vampires. Yeah, I could deal with that. \n\"Does Nick know I'm going over?\" I asked. \n\"Yeah actually. Jordan took your cell phone and called him. I guess the plan is already a done deal.\" \n\"So, what do I say to him about my neck and stuff?\" \n\"You don't have to worry about that any more. The holes are gone.\" \n\"What?\" I felt my neck. It was smooth and it didn't hurt or wasn't bleeding. \n\"Mr. Mathews trick . . . Jordan told Nick that you haven't been feeling well lately. Nick said he'll just let you stay home from school tomorrow and see how you are doing on Friday. Richard might hang around just to see how things are. I hope that's okay.\" \n\"That's fine. I don't really care if he's around.\" \n\"But, you do if Jordan or I are?\" He asked. \n\"No, that's not what I meant. Just some of them.\" \n\"It's fine. I can see how vampires can be annoying.\" \nAnnoying? More like disturbing vial little creatures. No offence to Jordan, Nile, and Richard. That's my thought about them. I like them but I just don't feel safe usually. I've already gotten bitten twice. I have lost a lot of blood this past week. I've been scared which isn't usual for me. I don't like knowing the truth about them. I think I would have liked it better if Jordan didn't tell me about vampires. But then again I would probably be searching for the answer what they all were and then get myself killed on the way. Not like I can really get hurt much more as I already am. \n\"Do you hate vampires?\" He asked. \n\"Huh? Oh, uh . . .\" I stopped to think \"Just certain ones I guess.\" \n\"I'm sorry you have to go through this.\" \n\"It's fine.\" \nI've gone through a lot my whole life. It's not like this little thing will change anything. \nI heard a click and looked over. Jordan came in the room. \n\"You're awake?\" He said. \n\"Yeah.\" \n\"That's good to hear.\" He closed the door. \"How are you feeling?\" \n\"Tired, weak.\" \n\"You'll feel better soon.\" Jordan looked at Nile. \n\"I already told her.\" Nile said. \nHe looked back at me. \"Will you be okay at Nick's?\" \n\"Yeah, fine.\" \nHe nodded. \"Okay.\" \nJordan turned to Nile and started talking to him. I wasn't paying attention to their conversation. It wasn't that important. I still don't know why my neck was bleeding in the first place. And how did the holes go away on my neck, just like that? This Mr. Mathews must be a good guy. According to Jordan and Nile's conversation he already went home. I guess I won't be seeing him today. \nSo tomorrow I get to go to Nick's till Sunday night. I feel a lot better about that. Although Richard will be watching, I could care less. Nick is one of those people who you just have to love. I love Nick like my older brother. I don't care if Richard is watching or not. Nothing will come in between me and Nick. No matter what. \n\n\n"

Nick said he'd pick me up at noon. I feel a little better today and have some of my energy back. That's a good sign. Before I just felt so tired but I actually feel good today. I'm glad just to get a weekend away from vampires. It will just be Nick and I. Like it use to be when my dad worked a lot. Those were the good old days. Now I hardly see him and my dad is gone. I haven't really cried much since my dad died. Actually I don't remember crying that day. I think I was over at Nick's house. I was sad but I don't know if I cried . . . \nI was dressed and had one of my bags packed. I won't be gone for very long. \nThere was a knock on my door. \n\"Come on.\" I said. \nNile came in my room. \"Nick is waiting down stairs.\" \n\"K.\" I grabbed my bag sitting on my bed and came out of my room. \nNile didn't say anything as we walked down stairs. I couldn't tell if he was upset or if that was how he just acted. Nick stood by the door next to Jordan. I went over and gave him a hug. \n\"Hey, how are you doing?\" He asked me. \n\"I'm doing okay.\" \nNile came over and stood by Jordan. \n\"Who is this?\" Nick asked. \nI forgot he still doesn't know about everyone living here. \n\"This is Nile.\" I said. \"He's a friend of mine.\" \n\"Nice to meet you Nile.\" Nick said. \n\"You too.\" \n\"Are you ready?\" Nick asked me. \n\"Yeah.\" \nHe took my bag from my hand and carried it for me. \n\"I'll have her back Sunday night.\" He said. \n\"Okay.\" Jordan said. \"See you Kiara.\" \n\"Bye.\" \nJordan and Nile didn't really look happy. They looked more depressed or something. I think they're just tired because of what happened yesterday. I have no clue. I wonder if vampires have mood swings. They're just like humans . . . they just suck blood. \nThe butler opened the door for us. His eyes were still dark like yesterday. Nick didn't take any notice to it. I think he was use to the creepy butler but I'm still keeping an eye on him. \nNick and I got in the car and he drove off away from the mansion. Maybe being out of the mansion will help the vampires a little. I know I am a bother to them. Well, instead of Jordan and Nile. They're both my friends but the other vampires still give me glares. I can't really say I haven't got hurt from living there but I can say that I'm not dead . . . yet. \n\"Do you not like it there?\" Nick asked. \n\"Uh - it's not that. I just wanted to get away. I feel like I'm in the way.\" \n\"You can stay at my house. You know that don't you?\" \n\"Yeah, I know.\" \nI just feel like my dad put me in that house for a reason. If he knew they were vampires, maybe he wanted me to do something. I still don't know anything about how Jordan knows my dad. Or even if he knew my dad. My dad could have picked a random number off the street and tell me to go there. I don't know. Like Nick said my dad was nuts. Sometimes he lost it in the head but other times he just acted like any other adult. \n\"Did you miss me?\" Nick asked. \n\"If I said so you'd mock me.\" \nHe laughed. \"I wouldn't mock you. I haven't seen you since Saturday. It's been about 5 days.\" \n\"Still . . .\" \n\"Richard is coming over tomorrow. I hope that is okay.\" \n\"Yeah, that's fine.\" \n\"It will just be me and you tonight.\" \nJust me and him. Sounds good. \n\"So how's school been going?\" He asked. \nWouldn't know. I only went for one day. And the one day I did go I was dragged in a room with some crazy vampire. \n\"It's been fine.\" I answered. \n\"Have you been getting homework?\" \nHomework . . . homework? Oh wait, I do have homework. Which I never did. It was suppose to be due today but since I'm not going tomorrow or today. Ha, I'm so lucky I'm not going to school. I still don't understand how they convinced Nick to let me stay home. I don't know, I don't care. I'll take the opportunity. \nNick pulled up in the drive way and we got out of the car. I walked in his house and as soon as I did I looked down at the ground. I keep picturing blood spots on the ground. That's bad. I'm shocked I'm not dreaming about blood or vampires. That reminds me. \n\"How are your arms and legs? From, when you fell?\" I asked. \nHe shut the door and set my bag down on the chair in the living room. \"I've been doing okay. Some bruises still but they'll heal.\" \nI went over to his couch and laid down. I don't have to worry about some vampire telling me to move off the couch. I can just do whatever. \n\"Will you be okay sleeping on the pull out couch tonight?\" Nick asked. \n\"Yeah.\" \n\"I would put you in the other room. But it's filled up with your dad's stuff. You could always sleep on the floor in my room.\" \n\"I'm not a little girl anymore, Nick.\" \n\"Okay, just saying.\" He went out in the kitchen. \"Are you hungry? I can make you something.\" \n\"No. That's okay. I'm good.\" \nSo peaceful here. No stressing over anything. No vampires. No sight of blood anywhere. No one is stalking me. Yeah, I think I can live with this. It's beyond me why my dad couldn't let me stay with Nick. Nick is like relative to me. He's just like an older brother to me. \nLater that night it was 8 and Nick and I were going to watch a movie. I set up my bed so I wouldn't have to do it after the movie. I got comfortable in my PJ's and sat down. Nick sat in the chair to the right of me. Nick pressed play on the remote. I don't really know what movie it is but anything is good. \nIt got about 40 min into it and I didn't get the movie at all. Nick was watching one of those murder mystery movies. I don't watch those kinds of things. I don't understand it so I just don't watch them. I can't tell who killed who or what. I was getting really tired for some reason. I had enough sleep last night so I shouldn't be this tired. But I am. \nI was watching the last of the movie and it didn't make sense for some reason. I sat there and then all of a sudden the lights went out. Everything. I couldn't see anything in front of me. \n\"Nick?\" I said. \nHe didn't answer. \n\"Nick? Nick where are you?\" \nI got up from the pull out couch and felt around me to where I was going. I came to the chair where Nick was sitting. I felt the chair. He wasn't there? I heard something creek across the floor and I felt like I had a mini heart attack. \n\"Nick? Nick this isn't funny. I'm going to kill you if you're going to scare me.\" \nI waited for his response but he never said anything back. I saw something flicker in the corner of my eye and I looked over. I think there is a light on in the kitchen or something. Maybe Nick got a flash light from the drawer. I moved around the chair and started walking toward the light. I could hardly see what was in front of me. I went to go turn the corner and I put my foot in something without thinking what it was. I slipped and fell. I felt wet all over me. Did I slip in water or something? No, I don't think its water. It's too thick. I went to go get up and I set my hand on something. The lights all of a sudden flashed on and I found out what I fell in. I was surrounded by a puddle of blood. I was touching something and I didn't dare to turn around. But something told me to. I don't know what but I was tempted to. I turned around slowly and I found an unpleasant sight and screamed as loud as I could. \n\n\n"

You were screaming.\" He said. \nI started crying. \nThat was a dream. It was all a dream. I thought it was real. I thought Nick was dead. \n\"Hey, why are you crying? Did you have a bad dream?\" He said sitting next to me. \nI didn't say anything. \nNick pulled me over to him and made me lay down. I put my head on his lap. \n\"Try to go back to bed.\" He said. \nI don't think I can go back to bed. That dream was horrible. I don't even remember falling asleep. I'm glad it was all a dream. I don't ever want something like that to happen. \nI was sleeping and then the phone rang. Nick stayed with me all night. I felt better that he did. I didn't mean for him to stay with me but I felt comfortable. I am probably like a 6 year old to him. \nI felt Nick reach his arm over to pick the phone up. \n\"Hello?\" He said still half asleep. \"No, I'm up. What's going on? . . . Yeah that's fine. Okay, bye.\" He hung the phone up and set it down. I felt Nick put a hand on my head. \nI didn't feel like getting up. I hardly slept last night. I rubbed my face and opened my eyes. The sun came in through the windows. It was morning already. I sat up still tired. \n\"Richard is coming over at one.\" Nick said. \nI looked over at the clock. It was eleven. It doesn't even feel like eleven it feels like eight in the morning. \n\"You can sleep up stairs for a little longer.\" He said. \"You didn't sleep that good last night. You kept waking up in the middle of the night.\" \nI did? I don't remember. The only thing I remember is that one dream I had. \nNick got up. \"I'm going to get ready. You can get some breakfast or whatever.\" \nI nodded and Nick went upstairs. I got up and went over to my bag and got my cell phone out. I flipped it up. Ten new text messages. From who? \nShelby texted me nine times asking me why I didn't come in yesterday and why I'm not there today. I just texted her back saying I didn't feel well. She's going to get suspicious because I was fine the last time I saw her. Oh well, she'll believe me . . . hopefully. I looked at the tenth message I had. It was Jordan. Jordan . . . I can't even get away from him. I'd rather talk to him by phone then person actually. He asked me a question. 'Did you have a nightmare last night?' \nWhat? How does he know I had a nightmare? That little stalker. I can't get away from him. I'll lie to him and then we'll see if he was actually stalking me. I put 'no.' While I waited for his reply I went in the kitchen to see what Nick had for breakfast. Probably not a lot. I looked in the fridge. No milk. Great. That eliminates half of everything on the list. I opened the freezer door. No waffles. He ate them all! I'll have toast. I went over to the bread box. No bread. Damn it Nick. When I come over you're suppose to go shopping. What the hell does that boy eat if he never goes shopping? \nMy phone vibrated in my hand. I opened it up. \n'You're lying to me.' \nDamn it. How does he know that? If he is stalking me I could press charges. I'm not joking. That's option D if I don't have anything else to get rid of him. But, I wouldn't send him to jail. Unless he sucked any of my blood than yeah that would be my best option. I don't know what to put. What do I say to him!? \nI thought about it for a second. I just won't answer him. I like that idea. I set my phone down on the counter and went to go see what else Nick had in the cupboards. My phone vibrated on the counter. I went over and it said Jordan. No, I'm not answering it. Forget it. It vibrated again. It was Jordan texting me again. It kept vibrating and vibrating. Stupid idiot I'm not picking it up. I got the phone and took the battery out of it. Ha, you can't text me anymore. The home phone rang. \nYou've gotta be kidding me. I went over and picked it up. \n\"Would you stop doing that!\" I yelled. \n\"Um - Kiara? It's me Richard.\" \n\"Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else.\" I smacked myself in the head. I'm such an idiot. \n\"It's okay. Is Nick there?\" \n\"Um, I think he is taking a shower.\" \n\"When he gets out can you tell him I called?\" \n\"Yeah of course.\" \n\"Thanks. Oh and Kiara?\" \n\"Yeah.\" \n\"Have you had any, nightmares lately?\" \nGosh not him too! Is he stalking me with Jordan! \n\"Um I, uh -.\" \n\"Have you?\" He asked again. \nMinds well tell him. \"Yeah. I did last night.\" \nI don't really get what the big deal is. I just had a bad dream. Most people get those. \n\"If you get any more could you tell me?\" He said. \n\"Uh, sure. But why does it matter?\" \n\"I don't think I should tell you right now.\" \n\"But it's about me. I should now.\" \n\"I'm sorry but it's just not the time yet.\" \n\"Okay fine. Whatever.\" \n\"See you at one.\" He hung up without letting me say another word. \nWhat's been going on? None of these damn vampires will tell me anything. They're all keeping things from me. It was a dream. It was nothing. Tonight I will go to bed and nothing will happen. \nIt was 1:10 and Richard isn't at the house yet. I was dressed and ready and so was Nick. There was absolutely nothing for breakfast so I skipped the idea of breakfast and made myself some soup. It didn't really fill me up but I can handle it till dinner. Oh gosh I don't even wanna know what we're having for dinner. If I can't find anything for breakfast what makes you think there will be dinner. \nThere was a knock at the door. I know who that is. I got off the couch and opened the door. \n\"Hey Kiara.\" Richard rubbed my head. \nGreat. Now I have to go wash my hair again. \nHe came in and I shut the door. \nI feel a little awkward around him because of our conversation on the phone. I mean I know I didn't get him angry or anything but I feel like because he's keeping something from me I can't be normal around him. \n\"Hey Richard.\" Nick said from the living room. \n\"Hey.\" He said and went into the living room. \nRichard seems like a human to me even though he has pale skin and sharp teeth. He doesn't bother me as much as the others do. But that's just me for ya. \n\"What's been going on?\" Richard said sitting on the couch where I was sitting. \nI moved my bag off the chair and sat in the chair because he took my seat. \n\n\n"

Richard was about to leave the house. What was up with the blood on his shirt? I saw someone in the window. Did he go after them? Ugh! I need to stop thinking about it. \n\"See you around.\" Richard said. \n\"See ya.\" Nick said. \n\"Bye Kiara.\" Richard yelled to me. \n\"Bye.\" I said. \nRichard left and Nick closed the door. I heard the car start and then leave. Nick came over and sat on the couch next to me. \n\"What a day.\" He said rubbing his face. \nWhat a day? Ha, I'm the one who knows the secrets around here. I should be saying that every day. \n\"I have some good news.\" He said looking at me. \n\"What is it?\" I asked. \n\"I'm going to ask Autumn to marry me tomorrow.\" \n\"What? Are you kidding me?\" \n\"No, I'm not kidding. I'm taking her out for dinner tomorrow night.\" \n\"Really? That's so great.\" \n\"You're coming right?\" \n\"Yeah of course. I wouldn't miss it.\" \n\"Do you want to bring a friend?\" \nI thought about it. Well I don't really wanna bring Shelby because she'll talk half the time and then most of my friends, if you want to call them that, are vampires. Do I really want to bring Nile? \n\"No. That's fine. I'll just come.\" I said. \n\"Okay.\" \n\"So, where is it?\" \n\"Where's what?\" \n\"The ring. I want to see the ring.\" \nHe got up and I followed him. He went upstairs in to his room and went in his drawer and took out a black little velvet box. He opened it up. It was a silver ring with a round diamond on top. It was beautiful with the light hitting it. That thing must have cost him a lot. \n\"Do you think she'll like it?\" He asked me. \n\"Yeah. I think she'll love it.\" \nHe closed it back up and put it in his drawer. \n\"So how long have you been planning this one?\" I asked. \n\"About a couple of months now.\" \n\"Why didn't you tell me sooner?\" \n\"I don't know. I was still debating whether or not I should do it. But I decided I am.\" \n\"Aw, that's so cute. But are you sure you want me to come? I can always stay here.\" \n\"No, I want you to come along. You're like family to me. It wouldn't be the same.\" \nWow, my Nick is growing up so fast. He usually sits on the couch playing Call of Duty but now he's getting engaged! He's moving on to girls now. I'm so proud of him! \nNick cocked his head at me. \"What's wrong with you?\" \n\"Nothing. I'm just kind of in shock that's all.\" \n\"Aw.\" He came over and gave me a hug. \"You'll find that guy for you.\" \n\"That's not what I was talking about.\" \nHe laughed. \"You can still come over, you know that right?\" \nI nodded. \nIt's going to be sad letting my little Nick go to some other person. Well, I'm going to have to get use to having another person live here. That's alright. Having another girl here is a good thing. Maybe I can do girl bonding time with Autumn while she is here. That would be nice. \nI was having a bad dream again. I already knew it was a dream because I picked up where I left off last time. I was screaming because I was sitting in a puddle of blood. I could feel the warmth of the blood just by sitting in it. It's disgusting yet something isn't letting me get up. I was shaky and my hand was still on something. Last time I turned around it was Nick. I don't dare to turn around again. I forced myself to get up and go toward the living room. My clothing was drenched in blood. I felt like getting sick but I tried to think to myself that it was all a dream. It doesn't feel like a dream at all. I can feel the pain and suffering of it. It's not normal, is it? \nI forced myself to walk away from where I was sitting and I went toward the window. I don't know why the window but I went over anyway. I stared outside at the other house next door. I wasn't expecting anything to happen but something I felt that was very evil popped up on me at the window. It scared the hell out of me and I started screaming. \nSomeone was shaking me once again and I opened my eyes. Nick was sitting next to me. \n\"Kiara . . . Why are you screaming? This is the second night in a row.\" He said sitting next to me. \nI sat up. I looked over to the window. Nothing was there. I looked back over to Nick who was still waiting for me to reply. \n\"I've been having . . . bad dreams.\" I said. \n\"Like?\" \n\"I don't want to talk about it.\" \nNick stared at me. \"Do you want to come upstairs with me?\" He asked. \n\"No.\" I laid back down facing away from him. \"Just go back to bed. I'll be fine.\" \n\"Are you sure?\" \n\"Yeah.\" \n\"Alright . . . Just come upstairs or yell if you need me.\" He got off the pull out couch and I heard him go back upstairs. \nI laid there feeling scared. I don't want Nick to comfort me. I'm 16. I think I can handle a bad dream on my own. It won't happen. That won't ever happen. \nA hand touched my forehead. I opened my eyes and looked up. Nick was dressed and was looking down at me. \n\"Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.\" He said taking his hand off my forehead. \n\"It's fine.\" \n\"Kiara you haven't been sleeping at all. I've been sitting here for two hours watching you. You keep tossing and turning then you talk to yourself in your sleep. Are you sure you're okay?\" \nI do those things while I'm sleeping? I don't ever remember doing that during the night. \n\"Yeah, I'm fine.\" I said. \n\"You don't have a fever or anything.\" \n\"I'm not sick. I'm fine. Really.\" \n\"What's that guy's number? That Jordan dude.\" He said changing the subject. \n\"Why do you want to know?\" \n\"I want to talk to him for a minute.\" \n\"You're not going to tell him about my dreams are you?\" \n\nThis comment may be offensive. \n\n"

If I leave what's Nick going to say.\" I said to him. \n\"Just tell him you're going to the bathroom and sneak out with me.\" \nI groaned and went over to Nick. \nNick knows me by now. Do you think he'll find out when I lie to him? I guess I'll find out. \n\"I'll be back. I have to use the bathroom.\" I told Nick. \n\"Okay, but what did Nile want?\" He looked back to where Nile was. \nI turned around. Nile wasn't there. What the hell? Where did he go? \n\"Um, He . . . found out I was here . . . and just wanted to say hi to me.\" I said making it up. \n\"That was nice of him.\" Nick said. \n\"Yeah nice . . . I'll be back.\" I said going to the back of the restaurant where the bathrooms were. \nWhere did he go? I don't even know where I am going. \nSomeone grabbed me by the arm. \n\"This way.\" Nile said pulling me to the left. \n\"What's going on?\" I asked. \nHe ignored my question and we just kept walking. We came to the kitchen and we slipped in. The people who were cooking were ignoring us. That was a good thing because I really don't feel like getting in trouble by the cooks here. We went to the back of the kitchen and there was an exit. Nile dragged me outside with him. \n\"Where are we going?\" I asked. \"What's going on?\" \n\"You're being tracked.\" He said dragging me to his car. \n\"Tracked by who?\" \n\"One of the top vampires. He knows you live with us. He's tracking you and is coming here. I have to get you away from here until Jordan gives me a call to say it's safe.\" \n\"How long till that?\" \n\"Not too long . . . Get in.\" He said letting me go so we can get in his truck. \nI got in his truck and buckled up. Nile drove out of the parking lot. \nI don't want to miss Nick proposing to Autumn so whoever this damn vampire is he better go away. \n\"So uh, where you taking me?\" I asked. \n\"I don't know. Anywhere but here.\" \n\"Could you go to the beach?\" \n\"Why the beach?\" \nI shrugged. \"I use to go to the beach everyday during the summer to watch the sunset.\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"Why not?\" \nHe didn't say anything to me. He just took a right turn and headed for the beach. \nI thought this weekend with Nick was so suppose to be away from vampires. I don't mind having Richard over but I really wanted to get away from Nile, Jordan, Drake, and all the others. \n\"I heard you haven't been sleeping lately.\" Nile said. \nOh great. Nick told Jordan who told Nile. I'm probably right on that one. \n\"What are your dreams about?\" He asked. \n\"I'm not telling you.\" \n\"Why not?\" \n\"Because I just don't.\" \n\"Are they about vampires?\" \n\" . . . I don't know. I don't want to talk about it.\" \nHe sighed. \"Whatever.\" \nNile parked at the beach parking lot. I was staring off in thin air and Nile snapped at me. \n\"Huh?\" I looked over at him. \n\"Do you want to get out of the car?\" He asked. \n\"Uh, ya.\" I opened the door and hopped down then slammed the door. \nBefore I went over to step in the sand I looked at my shoes. Nick just bought these for me. I'll get sand in them . . . \nI took my shoes off and carried them in my hand. \n\"What are you doing?\" Nile asked. \n\"I'll get sand in my new shoes.\" I said stepping into the sand. My feet sunk in and the sand went in between my toes. \nNile stared at me with a faint smile on his face. \n\"What?\" I asked. \n\"Nothing.\" He said walking on the sand too. \nNile and I walked along the side of the ocean. \n\"Why are you dressed up anyway?\" Nile asked. \n\"Nick was going to propose to Autumn, his girlfriend. So we went out for dinner and Nick made me wear this.\" \n\"You look cute.\" He said smiling. \n\"Uh, thank you.\" I said looking away. \n\"I hope I didn't ruin it.\" \n\"Nick will probably wait for me to come back . . . If I come back.\" \n\"Sorry.\" \n\"Its fine . . . um so did Drake leave?\" I said looking back at him. \n\"Yeah actually he did. Yesterday.\" \nYesterday . . . That's when I saw someone in the window . . . \n\"Hey um you wouldn't happen to know anything about what happened to Richard, would you?\" I asked. \n\"Richard? No, I don't think so. Why?\" \n\"Uh, no reason.\" \n\"No, tell me.\" \n\"Nothing, never mind.\" \nNile shut up. \n\"Do you know what Nick told Jordan?\" I asked changing the subject. \n\"Yes actually I do.\" \n\"What did he say?\" \n\"I'm not telling you.\" \nWe're going to play this little game, aren't we? It sucks not being at the mansion. I don't get to know the latest gossip. Vampire gossip. Ha, that sounds funny. \n\"What are you thinking about in that head of yours?\" Nile said flicking me in the head. \n\"Ow. Nothing.\" I said rubbing my head. \n\"You seem very alert or something.\" He said. \n\"Alert? How do I look alert?\" \n\"I don't know . . . Did something to happen while you were at Nick's?\" \n\"No . . .\" \nHe stopped me from walking and made me face him. \n\"What happened?\" He asked. \n\n\n"

The sun shined through the window and I didn't hear anything. I don't know if Nick is awake or not. I don't even know if I'm dreaming still. I looked over to my left. Jordan wasn't there. Was that a dream or wasn't it? I got up and walked to the kitchen. I got the milk in the fridge and poured some in a glass. Nick went shopping yesterday. I'm happy because now I don't have to starve. As I went to go take a sip someone poked me in the side and I dropped my milk all over the floor. I turned around to go slap who did that. Nick was going to stop my hand if I hit him. \n\"See what you did.\" I said. \"Clean it up.\" \n\"What? You're the one who dropped it.\" Nick said. \n\"You're the one who scared me.\" \n\"Yeah, I've noticed you've been getting scared a lot.\" \nWell if you lived with vampires you'd know how I feel. \nNick walked away. I got up on the counter away from the milk that was now running down the floor. Tonight I get to go back to vampire hell house. I don't want to . . . Nick came back in the kitchen with paper towels. He has them all stocked up in the bathroom. Which is weird because he should just leave them down here in the kitchen. \n\"You're useless.\" He said ripping off a big thing of paper towels. \n\"Not my fault.\" \nNick came over and placed the paper towels over the milk. \n\"So um, Autumn said yes?\" I asked. \nHe looked up at me from the floor. \"Do you not remember any of this?\" He asked. \n\"Uh, I don't know.\" \nHe wiped up all the milk and threw away the paper towels. He put the cup in the sink. \"What do you mean you don't remember? When we came here you got dressed and went straight to bed. You were like one of those walking zombies.\" \n\"I'm sorry, I just don't remember.\" \n\"So, did you want to go through your dad's stuff today?\" He asked changing the subject. \n\"Uh, no not today. Next week will be good.\" \n\"That's good. You're definitely not yourself this week. Are you happy to be going back to the mansion tonight?\" \nHell no. \n\"I guess. So when is your wedding?\" \n\"Not sure. Autumn and I are going to hang out tomorrow to figure it all out.\" \nI hopped off the counter. \"I'm taking a shower.\" I said dragging my feet across the floor to the stairs. \n\"Okay.\" \nI took a shower and then came back down stairs. I got all my stuff and put it in my bag. I'll probably end up at the mansion at 6 tonight. I have school tomorrow and there is no excuse for me to miss school. I've skipped too many days. Anymore days and people will get suspicious. Especially Shelby. I haven't pick up any of her calls. She will probably hate me tomorrow. \nSomething hit me in the head. I turned around and looked down at the floor. Nick threw a pillow at my head. \n\"What was that for?\" I asked. \nHe shrugged. \"You need get happy or something.\" \n\"What does that have to do with hitting me in the head?\" \nHe shrugged again. \"Because you deserve it for spilling milk on my floor.\" \nI picked up the pillow and threw it back. \"It wasn't my fault.\" I said angry. \n\"Whoa, chill. It was a joke.\" \nI moved my bag off the chair and sat down. I felt very lonely for some reason and I just felt like being held. So I pulled my knees up against my chest and wrapped my arms around them. I'm so tired. I haven't slept at all for the past 3 nights. I feel like going to bed but I don't want to have another dream. I can't stay up forever though. Not unless I had some caffeine but that really wouldn't last forever on me. \n\"So, are we just going to sit here all day?\" Nick asked. \n\"Yep.\" \n\"Do you want to go somewhere?\" \n\"Like where?\" \n\"Well I don't think you want to go to the movies again. I don't really have money to go to the mall. What about bowling? Do you like bowling?\" \n\"Bowling? Wearing shoes that were on other people . . . yeah sure why wouldn't I love bowling.\" \n\"Good. Because that's where we're going.\" He said getting up. \n\"What? Wait now?\" \n\"Yes now. Come on.\" \nMy hair is still wet though. I just sighed and got my flip flops on. I put a pair of socks in my pocket because there is no way I'm sticking my foot in a shoe that had someone else's feet in it. I got in the Nick's car. I don't really feel like going bowling but oh well. It's better than getting stuck in the house. \nIt took us about 10 min to get to the bowling alley. I got out of the car and walked in with Nick. I looked around at all the people. It was packed. That's great. I hate when people watch me. Nick walked up to the counter I didn't pay attention to what he was saying I watched some of the people bowl. \n\"Excuse me.\" \nI looked over the counter. \n\"What's your shoe size?\" The lady asked me snobby. \n\"Oh, size 9.\" \nShe got the shoes and put them slammed them on the counter in front of me. \n\"Thank you.\" I said. \nBefore she went to go turn around I could see she rolled her eyes. Some people are very rude these days. \nNick nudged me. \"Lane 6.\" He said and started walking. \nI followed behind him. We walked to lane 6. And look we have to share an area with someone. There were four teenage boys to the left. Oh gosh I gotta bowl with those guys watching me. \n\"I'll grab a ball for you.\" Nick said going back. \nI felt unprotected after he left. But when I sat down on the side of the step to put the shoes on, the guys didn't pay attention to me. But I don't think they noticed I was there. That's fine with me. \nNick came back with a blue and a green ball. He set them down on the center thing. When I got the shoes on I put my flip flops on one of the seats that the guys weren't using. Nick sat down in front of the screen to start the game. \n\"Okay, so how do you work this thing?\" He said pressing one of the buttons. \n\"You wanted to come here and you don't know how to start it?\" \n\"Um well I haven't been here since I was 18.\" He said trying to find another button to press. \n\"Move out of the way.\" I said pushing the button that said new game. \nThe graph popped up on the screen. I put Nick's name on first and then mine. \n\"You're first.\" I said. \n\n\n"

I got to the mansion in another 10 min. I don't want to face Jordan! He stole my first kiss from me. Thinking about just kissing a vampire that sucked another person's blood just creeps me out. Although he takes pills he had to in one point of his life suck blood. Oh God help me. \n\"What's your problem?\" Nick asked me. \nI turned around. \n\"Nothing.\" \n\"You've been very shaky since we left the bowling alley.\" \n\"No I haven't.\" \n\"Uh huh okay. Are you ready to leave?\" \nWhat? No I have at least 10 min left. \n\"Uh . . .\" \n\"Come on, let's go.\" Nick said. \n\"Are you trying to get rid of me?\" I asked. \nHe laughed. \"No I'm not trying to get rid of you. I thought maybe you would like to go back.\" \nWell I don't! \nI didn't say anything to him. \n\"You have to come back over this Saturday to go through your dad's stuff. We only have a few boxes left.\" He said. \n\"Yeah I know, and most of it is his papers from work.\" \n\"I can always hand them over to his boss. It's not going give us any information.\" \n\"Can I go through them before you give them away?\" \n\"Yeah of course. You might want to. You never know if your dad put your birth certificate in his work stuff.\" \n\"You haven't found it?\" \nHe shook his head. \"I think it's in with your dad's papers.\" \nOh great that means if some World War III broke out I'd have no evidence that I am an American citizen or have any record that I'm telling the truth about who I am. \n\"We'll find it before we give it away. Come on let's get you home.\" Nick said. \nHome? Ha, yeah right. I wouldn't call that place home. It's more like a walk in devil house. \nNick went over to the chair and picked my bag up. I had no choice but to get up and head to Nick's car. \n\"Do you have everything?\" Nick asked when he opened the door. \n\"Yeah, I'm pretty sure I have everything.\" I said heading out the door. \nNick shut the light off and we got in the car. As I was in the car I tried not to make it look like I was shaking. I'm nervous. I'm too nervous actually. Why'd he have to kiss me? He's a vampire and I'm a human. We are two completely different things. It's not normal. \nAbout 10 min later Nick pulled into the drive way. Here we go. To the vampire place. I felt normal these past days. Besides the dreams and the day Richard had blood on his shirt. I still haven't found out why blood was on his shirt. Or who was in the window. And the time I got bit while everyone went to a party. Speaking of that, Nile still owes me clothes because he burned them! I'm not really mad about it sense those clothes were worn out. Especially the sneakers. But they were my favorite. \nNick stopped the car in front of the mansion. \n\"You want me to come in?\" Nick asked. \nDo I want him to come in? Do I really want him to come in? \n\"No, I'm fine.\" I said. \n\"Ok, call if you need anything.\" \nI grabbed my bag from the back seat and hopped down from the hummer. \"I will.\" I said. \n\"See ya.\" \n\"Bye.\" I slammed the door and looked at the mansion. I sighed and walked up the stairs. I hesitated to open the door but the butler already had it open. \n\"Welcome back Miss. Hatake.\" The butler said. \nI walked in but stayed away from him at the same time. \"Yeah, thanks.\" \nSomeone wrapped their arms around my neck hugging me. \n\"You're back. It's been so boring here without you.\" \nI know who that is. Nile. \nNot even 20 seconds in this place and I have a vampire all over me. \nHe spun me around to him. He wasn't wearing a hat like he usually does. \n\"Whoa, you're not wearing a hat.\" I said. \n\"Oh, yeah I know.\" \nHis hair was brown which I already knew but you could actually see all his hair. \n\"I like it.\" I said. \n\"Thanks.\" \nI looked around. No Jordan. \n\"If you're looking for Jordan he's at a meeting.\" Nile said. \"He'll be back later tonight.\" \nPhew, he's not here. All I have to do is stay in my room all night. I have to face him in the morning though. \n\"We're having another meeting on Friday.\" He said. \"With everyone here, including you.\" \n\"What? Why?\" \nHe shrugged. \"I guess we'll find out Friday. I think some other vampires are coming too. I don't know who though.\" \n\"Lovely.\" I said. \nI slightly turned around and saw the butler staring at me. I looked back at Nile. I think Nile knew what I was thinking. \nNile grabbed my bag from my hand. \"Come on.\" He said walking toward the stairs. \nI walked with Nile upstairs. \n\"How did the proposal go the other day?\" Nile asked. \n\"Oh, it went good.\" \nToo bad I can't remember. \n\"So, she said yes?\" He asked. \n\"Yep. I don't know when they are having it though.\" \n\"Am I invited?\" He said smiling. \nSomething about Nile changed while I was gone. Yesterday he sounded . . . well not normal. Now today he sounds cheerful. It's rare to see Nile happy. \n\"I bet I can get you in.\" I said. \nI came to my bedroom and opened the door and flipped the switch. Everything was normal and nothing was touched. Everything was exactly the way I had it. I turned around to say something to Nile but before I did I was kissed by him. What's up with these vampires kissing me? He pushed me against the wall then leaned in again to give me a kiss. \n\"Whoa, what are you doing?\" I asked stopping him. \nHe stopped and didn't answer me. \n\"I need personal space.\" I said pushing him away. \nHe backed off and then rubbed his face. \"Sorry.\" He said. \nI looked away. \"Um, yeah I'm kind of tired. I think I'm going to bed.\" \n\"Uh, yeah okay.\" He said and walked out of the room and shut the door behind him. \nOh my gosh. I'm so confused with everything. Why today? No actually why at all? This shouldn't be happening. I rubbed my face. I am tired. And I really think I need rest. I went over to my bed a laid down. I closed my eyes trying not to think about anything. \nI was dreaming and it wasn't a very good one. The past nights I've been dreaming about blood and stuff at Nick's house but now I am dreaming about it at the mansion. I was walking down a hall that I've never been down before. I felt something pull me toward a door at the end of the hall. Nothing told me that it was bad; I just thought it would be a normal room. I was wrong when I opened the door. I saw the floor full of blood and I tried not to scream but it just came out. \nI opened my eyes and I was being held. \n\"Nothing's going to happen.\" Jordan said. \nI relaxed and leaned against him. These dreams are starting to get worse. I would rather have Nick wake me up then Jordan though. But it's too dark to see his face so I guess it's a good thing. Until tomorrow. \n\nThis comment may be offensive. \n\n"

I don't want to face Jordan or Nile. I wanted us all to be friends. Not this. I have to go down stairs though. Nile is probably waiting. I don't want to get in the car alone with him. \nSomeone knocked on my door. I opened it. Nile stood in the doorway. He didn't have a hat on. \n\"Yes?\" I said. \n\"I kinda wanted to talk.\" He said. \n\"If it's about last night, don't worry about it.\" I said going out in the hall and shutting the door behind me. \n\"Well, I don't want anything to be awkward between us.\" He said following behind me as we walked down the hall. \nThen you shouldn't have kissed me! \n\"It's fine.\" I said. \nI heard him sigh. \"Okay.\" He said. \nWe went down stairs. I was about to go head outside. \n\"Kiara.\" \nI turned to my right. Jordan . . . Oh gosh, why both of them in the same room. \n\"Here, take this.\" He said holding something out. \nIt looked like a pill or some kind of mint. It was round and white with green light spots on it. \n\"What is it?\" I asked taking it. \n\"It's a mint I think it might help you.\" \n\"If you're telling me my breath stinks I can go brush my teeth again.\" \n\"No that's not it. It's not an ordinary mint. You've been having bad dreams lately, right?\" \nI nodded. \n\"I'm positive that will help you.\" \nI looked at it in my hand. Looks like a mint. I put it in my mouth. Taste like a mint too. \n\"Oh Nile.\" Jordan said. \"Did you tell her about Friday?\" \n\"Yeah, I told her.\" \nGood. Looks like neither of them know they both kissed me. Let's keep it that way. \n\"Kiara . . .\" \nI snapped out of it and looked at Jordan. \"Yeah?\" I said. \n\"Did you hear what I said?\" \n\"Uh, no sorry I was thinking about something.\" \n\"I said the meeting will be in the dining room.\" \n\"Oh okay. What's it about anyway?\" \n\"Um . . .\" Jordan looked at Nile and back at me. \"You'll find out Friday. I'm not really suppose to discuss it yet.\" \nI guess I'm not going to get anything else out of this conversation. My mint started to get hot like something spicy. It's a mint. Mints aren't suppose to be that spicy. \n\"Hey uh what's this mint suppose to do?\" I asked Jordan. \n\"Nothing much.\" He said walking away. \"Get to school. You're going to be late.\" \nThat was not a straight answer. \n\"Come on.\" Nile said. \nI turned around and the butler had the door open. His eyes were back to normal. They weren't dark like Thursday when I left. Weird . . . I ignored it and kept going outside. We went out back and got in Nile's car. I kept my eyes out the window as Nile drove to school. I can't make him feel left out yet again I don't really want to look him in the face. \nNile pulled in a parking spot and I got out. Shelby is going to be pissed at me today. I haven't talked to her in a while. Nile started walking and I was going to walk behind him but he stopped and turned to me. \n\"You're walking in front of me this time.\" He said moving me in front of him. \n\"Why?\" \n\"Because the last time you were in back of me you got kidnapped by that guy.\" \nOh crap, I forgot about that guy. What was his name? Ben I think it was. Great now I have to worry about something else today. I walked in the doors of the school and Nile followed behind. I was right by my locker then I got punched in the arm so hard. I looked over. Shelby had these red eyes like she wanted to kill me. \n\"Where the hell have you been!?\" She yelled at me. \nI rubbed my arm. \"I've been sick.\" I said making it up. \n\"Sick! You said that last time. What's been going on? Have you been skipping school or something?\" \n\"I'm telling you the truth. I got sick.\" \n\"I have been taking all your notes, I've been gathering your homework for you, I even lied for you.\" \n\"Lied about what?\" I said opening up my locker. \n\"Ben asked me where you were.\" \n\"What? Why did he want to know that? What did you tell him?\" \n\"I don't know why and I said that you were at your grandma's house.\" \nMy grandma's house? My grandma is dead. Don't you think that he would find out? Anyway I'm pretty sure he knows about Jordan and all the others. So I wouldn't doubt it if he ended up at the mansion one night looking for me. \n\"Thanks.\" I said getting my stuff and then closing the locker. I looked over at Nile who stood there waiting to go to class. I don't think he was really concerned about the whole Ben thing. \n\"I didn't want to give out where you lived. Especially to some stranger. Anyway I don't know the address. What's your new address? Who are you living with? Where is it?\" \n\"Calm down Shelby.\" I said walking down the hall and everyone followed. Nile walked behind me and Shelby walked beside me. \n\"You know if you picked up your phone once in a while I wouldn't ask all these questions at once.\" \nIt's not my fault. Jordan wouldn't stop texting me so I just shut off my phone. Plus I'm not going to tell her I live with a boy who is the same age as me and also tell her there are 30 more people living in the house who are basically all the same age. And I'm most definitely not telling her they are all vampires. Especially when Jordan warned me if I told anyone I'd be turned into one of them. That's not worth risking. If I turned into one of them I'd probably kill myself. \n\"Kiara, are you going to tell me or what?\" Shelby said interrupting my thoughts. \n\"Oh uh . . .\" \nThe bell rung. \n\"I gotta go, I'll be later for class.\" I said walking faster. \nShelby stopped. \"What!? You're not going to tell me!?\" \nI just kept walking. \n\"Don't keep walking while I'm talking to you!\" She yelled. \nI got to my class ignoring Shelby and slowed down to my regular walk. \n\"You might have to tell her where you live.\" Nile said as we took our seats. \n\"Yeah right. What am I going to say? I live with 30 vampires in my house.\" I said whispering to him. \n\"You can tell her where you live. Just keep it on the DL about it.\" \n\"Well I'm not having her over. That's for sure.\" \n\"If you don't then she's going to get suspicious like she just did out in the hall. Its true how can you be sick one day and not the other day? I would be kind of suspicious too.\" \n\"Yes but see you're not because you live in the house too. What if I brought her over and some vampire thinks it's some snack wondering around? What would I do then?\" \n\"We're not monsters Kiara. If you told us that you were having another human over we'd understand.\" \n\"I don't care. I'm keeping her safe.\" \n\"Whatever loser.\" He whispered. \nI took my pencil and threw it at him. \n\"Ow.\" He said looking at me. \n\"You called me a loser . . .\" I whispered to myself. \nHe picked up the pencil and put it on his desk. \n\"That's mine.\" I said. \n\"Not anymore. You threw it at me.\" \n\"Fine then.\" \nWe didn't say anything else. I was still sucking on that mint Jordan gave me. It hasn't gotten any smaller. When he means it's not an ordinary mint does he mean it doesn't get small? I don't know. How is a mint going to keep me from having bad dreams? \nLater in the day at lunch time Shelby kept asking me over and over again about where I live, who I live with, can she come over. I tried to ignore or distract her from the questions but it's not going to work any longer. Like Nile said I'm going to have to tell her the truth sooner or later. But I choose later. The longer the better. My mint dissolved finally right before I got to the lunch room. It was kind of strange because mints only last like a couple of minutes and mine last a couple of hours. I guess I'll find out tonight whether it works or not. \nI sat in my room at the table doing my homework. It's not very hard. It's actually easy. Unlike some of the other stuff Miss. Gale gave me. That was kind of hard. But this is normal stuff I am doing. I'm glad to be at the public school. I need a little human influence on me. I wonder why Ben asked Shelby where I was. He grabbed me while I was walking in the hall. How mean is that. I don't even know the guy and he asked me all these questions. I'm not telling him anything. It's my life not his. \nThere was a knock and they opened the door. \n\"Dinner.\" Nile said. \n\"K.\" I said finishing up what I was doing and followed Nile. \nWhen we got to the dining room most of the vampires were sitting down. I'm actually not late this time. No one is waiting for me. I'm now getting use to eating dinner with everyone. I don't know half of their names but they all know my name. I went over and sat in my seat. \n\"Did that mint dissolve?\" Jordan asked me. \nI looked over at him and nodded. \n\"That's good. It won't take long for it to work.\" \nYeah, but what does it do? How does a little white thing make a bad dream go away? I don't even know what that shot was when he gave it to me. It either made my bite bleed or made the redness go down. Whatever it was it was weird. Then that guy made the mark go away. It's not even there anymore. It's smooth as can be. I wonder if that's why I am having bad dreams. No, I don't think so. It has to be something else. I just . . . I just don't know what. \n\n\n"

I tried hard to remember what I dreamed about . . . nothing. I dreamed about nothing. It actually worked! I can't believe it. I really went to bed and didn't have any bad dreams. It was so peaceful why do I have to get up for school. I sighed and rolled out of bed. What a pain. \n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ \n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ \nMy week was basically like a normal one. Jordan or Nile never mentioned the kiss. I haven't seen Ben in school at all and Shelby isn't mad at me. I have actually been answering her calls. Nick texted me and said his wedding was going to be on Christmas Day. That's not far away its four months away and they have a lot of work to do. Nick said that Autumn will be picking out my dress. I actually have a normal girl picking out my dress. That is such a big difference than Nick. No offence to him. \nDinners in the dining room were normal. I go, I leave, and then go to my room. It's actually been a very normal, normal week. Ever since I came here I've either been bit or kidnapped or have had bad dreams. None of that this week. Nothing. Well, except for maybe tonight . . . \nI sat on my couch flipping through the channels on the TV. Today is Friday. It's 6 and tonight is when we are suppose to have the meeting. Nile told me to stay in my room. He said he'll come in get me when the meeting starts. I'm nervous. Nile said there are other vampires coming. What kind of vampires? Nice ones? Mean ones? Ones that just want to suck out a humans blood when they see you? Jordan won't tell me what it's about and Nile said he doesn't know but I think he actually does. He just doesn't want to tell me or he just isn't allowed to. \nI heard the door open and looked over. \n\"Let's go.\" Nile said. \nI shut the TV off and went out in the hall with him. We walked to the dining room where I heard a lot of voices. When I got in there, there must have been at least 15 more vampires in the room. They all wore dark clothing but had light hair. They had dark eyes like the butler had before. You could see the evil in their eyes. I have a feeling they aren't good vampires. They all jerked their heads over as soon as I walked in. One vampire caught my eye. Ben . . . Ben was in the crowd of the vampires. What is he doing here? I moved close to Nile so I wouldn't be grabbed on either side of me. \n\"Kiara.\" \nI looked over. Jordan stood by the table. That's where we walked to. \n\"Those are the head vampires.\" Jordan said looking over to them then back at me. \"They call themselves The Crusaders.\" \n\"Why are they here?\" I asked. \n\"You.\" \n\"Me?\" \n\"Yes. Looks like they found about you staying here. They are here to discuss it.\" \n\"I thought I was allowed to be here though.\" \n\"Actually, a human is not suppose to know about vampires. Now that you know . . . well we'll see what happens.\" \n\"I'm not going to die am I?\" I said slowly. \nJordan shook his head. \"That's not going to happen.\" \n\"Are we ready sir?\" Someone said and ended up next to me. I jumped a little because I didn't know they were there. \n\"Yes, we are ready.\" Jordan said. \n\"Very well.\" He went away. \n\"Take your seat Kiara.\" Jordan said. \nI took my seat where I usually sit at the table every night. All the vampires that were in dark clothing sat on one side and all the people who lived in the house sat on the side I sat on and some were standing. I was getting nervous. What did they want from me? \n\"I'll speak first.\" Someone said on the other side of the table and stood up. It was a rather older guy no older than his 30's. His skin was pale and he had short light blonde hair. \"We have received some news that you have a human living here.\" He looked at me then at Ben. \nBen must have told. That's probably why he was asking me all those questions! He wanted to know who I lived with and how I knew about them. He turned me in. \n\"As we all know. Having a human know the truth is against our rules. And for that, there are consequences.\" He continued. \nOh great here we go. What's my punishment? \n\"She must either be killed or be turned into one of us.\" \nWhat? You have got to be kidding me. Jordan said he won't let me die but I don't want to be turned into a vampire. No way. Nah uh. I'm not doing it. \n\"No deal.\" Jordan said. \nEveryone gasped and looked at him. \n\"I say if she does not tell anyone about our secret she has every right to live and breathe. There is no reason for killing her or turning her immortal. Unless she abides by the rules then I see no harm in it.\" \nEveryone started whispering to each other. Then the man spoke again. \n\"Who can say, that she will keep our secret? How can we trust a human?\" \n\"She is the daughter of Pierce Hatake.\" Jordan said. \nMy father . . . what about him? \nEveryone started whispering again. \n\"The daughter of Pierce Hatake . . .\" One whispered. \n\"I thought she died.\" Another whispered. \n\"We trusted her father. Why not her?\" Jordan asked. \nYou trusted my father with what? What's going on!? \nSomeone on the other side of the table stood up. \"May I say something?\" He asked. \nJordan nodded. \n\"Yes, it is true that we all did trust Pierce Hatake. But remember he killed one of our own kind. He turned on us at the last minute. If he turned on us, don't you think she would? She has his blood in her. If it was his nature to do that. It can also be hers.\" \nI looked over at Jordan and looked at Nile who sat on my left side. They didn't bother to look at me. They had their attention on the man. \n\"Then what do you suggest we do?\" Jordan asked. \n\"Kill her.\" \nEveryone started whispering and agreeing. \nI froze. What if I really do die? Tonight. What's going to happen to me? \n\"I agree.\" The other man said. \"I think killing her would be the best option.\" \n\"I'm sorry, but I'm not going to allow that.\" Jordan said. \n\"You dare say that in front of us.\" The man said. \nJordan nodded. \nJordan knock it off. I don't want to die tonight. Just shut up and get me out of here. \n\"You're lucky you're the son of Lenox Trent or I would also kill you.\" He threatened. \nJordan stood up. \"That's enough. This is my house and I make the rules. I am the son of Lenox Tobias Remington Trent. If you don't like that I suggest you leave. I will not allow this in my house.\" \n\n\n"

Did you want to go shopping later today? You were going to get rid of the boxes right?\" \n\"Yeah.\" \n\"Alright, but you don't have any stuff for your room so we'll go later.\" \n\"Okay.\" \nHe cocked his head. \"You alright?\" \n\"Yeah fine.\" \n\"Okay.\" He left the room and shut the door behind him. \nI took the two pieces of paper out and looked at them again. I was positive that my father killed my mother. If she was murdered the day after my father went to the hospital for two holes in his neck then I am positive that he was turned into a vampire and slaughtered my mom. Why do you think he came home late every day? Because he was trying to hide the pain from trying not to kill me. Is that why he got two jobs? To keep him busy. How does Jordan know my dad? How did they meet? Is that why I was put there? Because my dad turned into a vampire and he met Jordan. What's going on? Maybe . . . maybe I'm wrong. Maybe this is all wrong. \nI don't really want to do this but. I took my phone out and went down my contact list. I pressed send and put the phone to my ear. It rang and the more it rang the more agony I was in. I have to find out the truth even if it means talking to Jordan. I haven't talked to him since Friday . . . It's been a whole weekend and he hasn't tried calling or texting me. Neither has Nile. \nThe phone stopped ringing. \n\"Is there something wrong?\" I heard Jordan asked concerned. \nMy heart froze in fear and I forced myself to say something. \"I want to know the truth about my father. Did he . . . turn into a vampire?\" As soon as I started talking I kept asking more questions. \"How do you know him? What happened to him? Did - .\" \n\"Can we talk in person?\" He asked interrupting me. \nI didn't see that one coming. \n\"I'll tell you everything.\" He said. \"Every question you have I'll answer.\" \n\"Where do you want me to meet you?\" I asked. \n\"Outside.\" \n\"Outside?\" I repeated confused. \n\"I'm out in the front. Come take a walk with me.\" \n\"I'll be out in a second.\" \n\"K.\" He hung up the phone. \nI put my phone in my pocket and went down stairs. Do you think Nick will let me take a walk without being suspicious? I said I was going to take care of the boxes but now I'm going for a walk . . . I went down stairs and Nick wasn't in the kitchen or in the living room. He must be in the computer room. I went in the computer room and he sat in the chair typing something up. \n\"Hey Nick, I'm going to take a walk.\" I said. \n\"A walk?\" He said while he stopped typing. \"I thought you were going to take care of those boxes.\" \n\"Yeah, I will when I come back. I need some fresh air.\" \n\"Okay . . . But you better take care of those boxes.\" \n\"I will, I promise. As soon as I get back.\" \n\"Fine. Whatever.\" He said looking down at his keyboard. \"You don't need to lose weight.\" He whispered. \nI ignored the little comment Nick said and headed outside. I didn't really feel like meeting Jordan but if it helps me to find out the truth I'll do it. I closed the door behind me and walked up toward the road. Jordan ended up on my right side. \n\"Let's go this way.\" He said going to the right. \nI followed and walked by his side. \n\"What's your first question?\" He asked as we walked. \n\"Was my dad a vampire?\" I asked slowly. \n\". . . Yes.\" He answered like he didn't want to tell me. \n\"How?\" \n\"He found out about vampires, then the people who were at the mansion on Friday, turned him into one. They didn't want to kill him because he had information they wanted. Don't ask me what. No one knows but them. They won't say what it was.\" \n\"Did he really kill, one of them?\" \nHe nodded. \"Revenge. Your father got turned into a vampire when you were seven. He killed your mom because well, when you're one of us, you want blood. He killed her for it. That's when I found him. Wandering the streets at night. He was mourning. I took him to the mansion and showed him the pills that we take. When he started getting use to them he decided to get two jobs to make sure he didn't hurt you.\" \nThat explains why I was alone that day. \n\"Does that explain most of your questions?\" \n\"Yeah, most . . .\" \n\"What other questions?\" \n\"Did you know me when I was little?\" I asked out of the blue. \n\"Yeah, I watched you while you were alone at the house.\" \n\"You watched me? You were spying on me.\" \n\"I wasn't really spying. I had permission to.\" He chuckled. \"You were so small then.\" \nGreat, so my whole life was around vampires and I was totally oblivious to it. What a joke. \n\"When I first came . . .\" I said changing the subject. \"Who bit me that Sunday night?\" \n\". . . Drake.\" He said softly. \n\"Really?\" \nHe nodded. \"I knew right away when I saw the mark. Drake and Dominic are the only ones who can poison a bite mark.\" \n\"Poison?\" \n\"They can poison the mark to make it bleed so the person can bleed to death.\" \nI rubbed my neck. Just thinking of dying from loss of blood just kind of freaks me out. It's scary. \n\"That's . . . nice.\" I said rubbing my neck still. \"Uh, did you know about that night when Richard came over . . .?\" \n\"Yes.\" He said interrupting me. \"I'm not going to explain everything but it was Drake.\" \n\"Why does he hate me?\" \n\"He knows that humans can't know about us. Why do you think he was trying to kill you before the others did?\" \nI shrugged. \"So where is he now?\" \n\"Who knows. Richard told me he went away. I don't know where he is right now.\" \n\"What happened last Saturday? I was in the car and I ended up back at Nick's house. What happened to me?\" \n\"Your dreams interrupting your reality. I'm not really sure why you have been having bad dreams? It has something to do with that shot I gave you and the shot Mr. Mathews gave you.\" \nSo this whole time I thought it was vampires messing with my dreams but it turned out to be the shot they gave me. \n\"How does a shot do that?\" I asked. \n\"Something to do with the chemicals reacting and going to your brain cells.\" \n\"What kind of shot did you give me?\" I said holding my arm. \n\"You won't get them anymore. That mint you ate made your brain cells cool down a little and help it work like it use to.\" \nHow can a mint make my brain cells cool down? Does it even have a temperature? \n\"Any more questions?\" He asked. \n\". . . How'd my dad really die? If he got in a car accident he would really die because he's a vampire.\" \n\"The Crusaders killed him. After he went for revenge they got revenge back at him. As you probably already know. There is at least one way to kill a vampire.\" \n\"Pulling them to pieces and burning them. I watch the movies.\" \n\"We're not really immortal because well we can die. But we're half immortals because we can live forever if we don't get killed.\" \n\"You're confusing me.\" \nHe laughed. \"Don't worry about that. You won't need to know any of that. So uh, you're not coming back?\" \n\". . . I don't think so. Not that I hate any of you but I just can't deal with all this now. I'd rather stay with Nick. I feel like I fit in more than I do there. I hope you understand.\" \n\"Of course. It's your life. I see how living with vampires can be a problem. You're always welcomed to come back . . . next question.\" He said changing the subject. \n\"I don't really have any right now.\" I said trying to think. \n\"You're all out of questions?\" \n\"Yep.\" \n\"You better go back and get rid of those boxes then.\" \n\"You're such a stalker.\" \nHe smiled. \"At least I'm not a bad stalker.\" He said and disappeared. \nI ended up back in front of Nick's house. Weird . . . I don't remember going around the whole block yet. I went inside. \n\"I'm back!\" I yelled to Nick. \n\"Okay, you better start going through those papers or we won't be able to go shopping tonight.\" Nick said. \n\"I will!\" \nGosh, they are just boxes. \nI put my hands in my pockets of my jeans and went in the kitchen to get a drink before I went upstairs. I held on to the piece of paper that was still in my jean's pocket. I stopped in front of the trash can and took the papers out. I looked at it one last time and ripped it in 4 different pieces. \nIt's time to move on. I was placed here not to be sad or angry but to live my own life the way I want it. I'm not going to keep myself in the past. Everything happens for a reason and I'm not going to question it. \n\n\n"

I found my birth certificate too. It was in with my dad's doctor appointment files. I gave it to Nick to put in the safe. Right now, we just got back from the store. I'm getting furniture moved in my room. I feel bad because I made Nick buy all this stuff just for staying here when I could be at the mansion staying there for free. But, I just don't want to go back. So I'll stay here with Nick and Autumn, after they get married. I can't stay with them forever. But just until I am 18 where I can do my own stuff. That's a couple of years from now. \nA little later everything was set up in my new room. My bed was against the left side of the wall and I had a dresser on the left side right by the door. I put a blue fuzzy rug down in the middle of the floor. I don't have a lot of stuff but its fine. I can buy stuff later for my room. But it looks really empty. \n\"Hey Kiara! Dinner is done.\" Nick yelled up. \n\"Okay.\" I said shutting my door and went down stairs. \nI went into the kitchen. Nick had a plate for me on the counter. I went over and grabbed the plate of spaghetti. I was too lazy to go over and sit at the table so I hopped up on the counter and ate there. \n\"Act like a lady and sit at a table.\" Nick said. \"No wonder you don't get boyfriends.\" He whispered. \n\"Shut up. I don't need a boyfriend to be happy.\" I argued with him. \n\"Okay . . . whatever.\" \n\"It's kind of weird you and Autumn are getting married on Christmas.\" \n\"Yeah.\" He said hopping up on the counter. \"It was Autumn's idea.\" \n\"I think it's a great idea.\" \n\"Yeah . . . it's not that far away.\" \n\"Are you nervous?\" \n\"A little.\" \n\"Never heard you admit that.\" I whispered. \"You don't have anything to be worried about. Everything will be fine.\" \n\"Thanks . . . So uh, you're not going to speak to Jordan at all?\" \n\"No . . . I think . . . I think we're better off that way.\" \nNext day at school. Nile or Ben didn't show up. I've been asking a couple of people and they said they moved away. One of the teachers said Nile did but I knew that was just a cover up for Nile getting out of school. But for Ben. I feel like he just went missing or something. It's a good thing though. That way I don't have to worry about any vampires getting in my way. Do you think Jordan and Nile understand? Is that why they are leaving me alone. It . . . it feels good being left alone. No blood sucking, no scars, no cold skin or sharp teeth. Just me and other humans. I haven't seen Richard . . . I wonder if he's staying away too. Or if he is just visiting Nick when I'm not there. Probably. I think all the vampires know about me. But, if they are out of my way then I won't get in theirs. \n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ \n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ \n~ ~ ~ ~ \n~ ~ ~ \n~ ~ \n~ \nSo as the days in my life past, nothing really happened. It was . . . normal. No vampires. Nothing. I haven't spoken to Jordan or Nile for a very long while. Richard kind of disappeared and Nick and I have been hanging out. Autumn has been coming over a lot. Today is the 20th of December. Sunday. Nick and Autumn are getting married this Friday. I'm so excited. She already has her wedding dress picked out. It's beautiful. She picked my dress out. It's a red strapless dress and it goes below my knees. I have a short sleeve red shrug to go over it and red Converse X-Hi Tops. Kind of weird for a wedding but Autumn said I could wear them. They are cool. Especially with a dress. \nI was sitting in a restaurant with Autumn and Nick. We were waiting for our food and Autumn and Nick were discussing their wedding. I sat there listening. \n\"What if we sat them over here?\" Autumn said pointing to a table in a diagram she made. \n\"No, I don't think they'll like that.\" Nick said. \n\"Yeah, but Mr. Patterson is there. They are good friends of him.\" \n\"I don't know. Mrs. Finch won't like that very much.\" \n\"She'll deal with it.\" Autumn said writing something on the diagram. \n\"You've been very quiet.\" Nick said looking at me. \n\"Huh? Oh, no I'm just listening.\" \nHe smiled. \"Hey, uh do you think we should tell her?\" He whispered to Autumn. \n\"Tell me what?\" I asked. \n\"Well it's too late now that she already knows that we'll tell her something.\" \n\"What?\" I asked louder. \nNick looked at me. \"We're moving.\" \n\"What?\" I said shocked. \n\"Yeah, to Georgia. It's only a state over.\" Nick said. \n\"Ha, only. That's like hours away.\" I pointed out. \n\"Kiara sweetheart.\" Autumn said. \"We already bought a beautiful house there. We already found a job to work out.\" \n\"Great money by the way.\" Nick added. \n\"And we have a bedroom there for you.\" Autumn continued. \n\"Georgia?\" I asked. \n\"Yes, Georgia.\" Nick said. \n\"That's uh, quite a ways out.\" I pointed out again. \n\"Yes. It's a big difference from here.\" Autumn said. \n\"You'll like it if we showed you what the house looked like.\" \nBut, this is where I grew up. This is where everything is. How can I move to a different state? This is just nuts. \n\"When?\" I asked. \n\"After our honeymoon.\" Autumn said. \n\"That soon?\" \nShe nodded. \"We were going to tell you sooner but we didn't know if it was official yet.\" \n\"Are you okay with that?\" Nick asked. \n\"Uh, I don't know.\" I said looking down. \n\"We know it's a lot to take in.\" Autumn said. \n\"I'd say so.\" I whispered. \nAutumn and Nick looked at each other then back at me. \n\"Kiara, if you don't want to come. You can always go back to Jordan's.\" Nick said. \n\"What? I - I don't want to go back to there.\" I said kind of unsure. \n\"Kiara I think you do. I've seen you sad these past months. You haven't had any new friends. You've been stuck in the house. You're lonely . . .\" \n\"I'm not lonely.\" I said. \n\"Yes you are. Whatever happened there, I think you're old enough to take care of it.\" \nI heard a slap sound and looked up. Autumn hit him. \n\"What?\" He said. \n\"Don't be rude to her. Maybe she just doesn't want to go back. You're very welcomed to come with us Kiara. The choice is yours. If you want to go back to Jordan's you can or if you want to come with us you can. Either way you are welcomed to. Think about it, okay?\" \nI nodded. \nI sat there in my seat already thinking about it. Should I go back to the mansion? Nick is right. I haven't had any new friends, I've been depressed, and lonely. Would it be a good thing to go back? Or am I making the right choice to go with Autumn and Nick? And I thought life would be so much easier without vampires. Now I have the choice to go back or stay. \n\n\n"

What if I went with Nick and Autumn and another vampire showed up. That would be really risky. They could get hurt and it would be my fault. If I went to the mansion no one would bother to attack them. They'd be safe. But if I go back . . . I could also get hurt. Jordan said he wouldn't let that happen. Should I trust him? I've trusted him so far. Why not with this? I'd be trusting a vampire with my life. That's hilarious. \nI was outside in the backyard lying on the grass staring up at the sky. I was listening to music on my iPod. The white puffy clouds passed by as I stared at them. Nick and Autumn were inside making more plans for their wedding. I wore my purple sweat shirt because it was kind of cool out today. The best thing about being in Florida is no snow. I don't get to see snow. It's always warm here. The closest I'll ever get to snow is if I take ice cubes from the freezer and crush them. \nI saw something move from the corner of my eye and was thinking it was Nick. I looked over to my right. A cat ran across the lawn into the neighbor's yard. Nope not Nick. I went to go look back up to the sky then someone face ended up in front of mine. I went to go scream but they covered my mouth. \n\"Shut up. It's just me.\" \nI stopped freaking out and looked at them. Nile? It's Nile . . . \n\"You look different.\" He said. \nI paused the song on my iPod and shoved his hand off from my mouth. I sat up to get a better look at him. His hair grew out . . . a lot. It was down over his eyes now. It also got darker. \n\"Haven't seen you in four months.\" I said. \n\"Yeah I know. I promised Jordan I wouldn't come but . . . It's been a long time.\" \nI looked over behind Nile to see if anyone was peeking through the back door window. No one was. I looked back at Nile. We kept silent for a little bit. \n\"Are you thinking of coming back?\" He asked. \n\"How do you know about that? Have you been spying on me? Or has Jordan? Because I know you -.\" \nHe came over and covered my mouth. \"No, we haven't been spying on you. This is the first time in 4 months I've seen you. Nick has been contacting us.\" \nThat little sneak. \nI pushed his hand off me once again. \"I don't know if I'm going back.\" I said not looking at him. \n\"Whatever. Your decision.\" He said calm. \nI looked up at him. \"You really need to cut your hair.\" I said changing the subject. \n\"Aw, why? I grew it out. I don't want to cut it.\" \n\"I can't see your eyes.\" \n\"You miss looking at my eyes.\" He said sarcastic. \n\"No.\" I said looking away. \nHe laughed. \"So, um, how have you been doing?\" \n\"Fine.\" I said fast. \n\"Were you expecting Jordan?\" He asked. \n\"What? No. I don't want to see Jordan.\" \n\"Oh really.\" \n\"Yes really.\" \nIt got quiet. I listened to the birds chirp from the trees and the wind whistle. I still didn't look at Nile. I wasn't going to do it. \n\"Will you at least think about coming back?\" Nile said breaking the silence. \n\"I have been. I have been all day and night.\" \n\"What's so wrong about coming back?\" \n\"Because it's not normal. Vampires. They aren't suppose to be real. They shouldn't be real. I can't live with that. Even my dad was a vampire. It's like I can't get away from them.\" \n\"That's all?\" \nI looked at him. \"What do you mean 'that's all'? If you were human and lived with vampires would you stay with them or go live with humans?\" I asked getting angry. \n\"I was never human. So I wouldn't know. But if I was human; I would go live with vampires. You won't ever go anywhere in life without taking risks. You're going to have choices like that. You're 16 Kiara, take some risks. You only live once.\" \n\"That's exactly the point. I only live once! Why would I go kill myself?\" \n\"You wouldn't be killing yourself idiot. No one is going to hurt you!\" He said getting angry also. \n\"You don't know that!\" I screamed at him. \"You were never human so how the hell would you know!? You have no idea what it's like getting bit by another vampire and think you're going to die. You don't know what kind of pain I have gone through to stay at your freakin' house! It's either some vampire trying to suck my blood or killing me because I know the truth about you. If I'm in the way of everything just kill me now and get it over with!\" \nWithin seconds he was on top of me making me pinned down to the ground. There was no escaping unless Nick or Autumn came outside. Which I highly doubt. \n\"You don't want me to kill you.\" He said with a soft voice. \"You're scared and I know that. But I never said you had to go back. It's your choice. If you want to stay with Nick and Autumn fine. We won't bother you. You're welcomed to come back to the mansion though. If you live there nothing will happen. Jordan already talked to those people. They aren't going to harm you. No one will.\" \nI laid there staring at him. \"I'll think about it okay. I'm not positive yet. I still have a couple of weeks.\" I said. \n\"Actually . . . Not really. Right after the wedding they're moving.\" \n\"No, Autumn said after the honeymoon.\" I argued with him. \n\"That's not what she told me.\" \n\"What did she tell you?\" \n\"They're going to drop you off at one of Autumn's sister's house in Georgia while they go on their honeymoon. You didn't actually think they'll leave you alone here did you?\" \n\"Wait, are you telling me that we're actually moving this Saturday.\" \nHe nodded. \nI pushed him off of me and got up. \n\"Where you going?\" Nile asked standing up. \n\"Finding out for myself.\" I said going inside. \nI walked inside. \"Hey Nick.\" I yelled as soon as I got in. \n\"In the kitchen.\" He said back. \nI walked into the kitchen. Nick had a binder in his leaning against the counter. Autumn was getting something out of the fridge. \n\"What is it?\" He asked looking up at me. \n\"We're moving on Saturday?\" I asked. \nAutumn and Nick looked at each other. \n\"You were going to drop me off at Autumn's sister's house in Georgia.\" I said. \nAutumn shut the fridge. \"We were going to tell you tonight actually. On Saturday we were going to move there and then drop you off at Monique's house. My sister.\" \n\"Why did you tell me before?\" \n\"We didn't want to rush you.\" Nick said. \n\"Well thanks. I'm feeling a lot more pressure!\" I said walking away and was going to go in the backyard again. \n\"Kiara.\" Nick said. \nI ignored him and went back outside. Nile wasn't there went I came out. I didn't care and I went back to where I was. My iPod was lying on the ground. I laid back down and put my earphones in and pressed play. Instead of looking up at the sky I laid on my side and curled up in a ball. If I'm safe then I can stay outside without any vampires bothering me . . . \nThe air got really cold all of a sudden and I woke up. The sun was going down. I fell asleep outside. I sat up and looked around. Nothing really happened while I was out here. Why didn't Nick or Autumn come and get me? Probably didn't want to disturb me. \nI sat on the ground thinking what Nile was telling me earlier. \n'You won't ever go anywhere in life without taking risks.' \nWithout taking risks? \nI stood up. \nMy dad wanted me to go there. Everything happens for a reason, right? \n\"Kiara.\" \nI turned around and saw Nick standing at the door. \n\"It's getting late. Come inside.\" He said. \nI walked up to him. \"I made my decision.\" I said to him. \n\"Really? What is it?\" \nThe door opened and I was surprised that it wasn't who I thought it would be. I didn't look at him. I kinda made my eyes wander around as I spoke. Looking up at the ceiling or to the side. \n\"Kiara?\" Jordan said. \n\"Uh, yeah, is it alright if I stay here . . . for good?\" I said staring at the ceiling and making my voice kind of shaky. \nI felt the bags in my hand leave me and he already had them in his hands. I couldn't help to look at him. Jordan's hair was at least an inch longer but nothing like Nile's hair. \n\"Come on.\" He said moving out of the way. \nI walked in. Everything was the same. Right in its place. I looked at the door. The butler was there. I think Jordan knew it was me, that's probably why he opened the door himself. I looked back in front of me Nile stood there. \n\"Finally came back huh?\" He said. \n\"Don't act like you were right.\" I said. \n\"Wait,\" Jordan said. \nI looked at Jordan. \n\"Before you stay here. We have to get something settled.\" \n\"What's that?\" I asked. \n\"Who are you going to choose?\" He asked. \nI looked at Nile and looked back at Jordan. \n\"Wait, what? You're going to make me choose now . . . between you two.\" I said. \nJordan nodded. \"When you give us an answer you can stay here.\" \n\"Whoa, that's so not fair.\" \n\"No, I think it is.\" Jordan said. \"You have to choose.\" \nI have to choose between these two. Nile is the more fun person but can be kind of mean and grouchy. Jordan is the more quiet and cute person. He keeps to himself but he's nice and cares. So does Nile. He can be nice and caring . . . \nI breathed in and looked at the two. \"I choose . . .\" \n\n\n"

Why the hell are they making me do this? This is so not fair! I can't just choose between them. If I choose one the other will hate me. \n\"I choose . . .\" I said slowly. \nI thought about it. \n\"Neither.\" I said fast. \n\"What?\" They both said shocked. \n\"Yeah that's right, I choose neither of you.\" I said all smart and mighty. \n\"Wait you can't do that -.\" Nile was saying. \n\"Oh, I think I can.\" I interrupted him. \"You never said I had to give you a straight answer. You also said when I give you an answer I can stay. Well you never said I couldn't wait a couple of years.\" \nOr never. \n\"I think if you really wanted me to stay you wouldn't make me do this.\" I continued. \"True love waits. So when I'm ready I'll give you an answer. But for a couple of years I want to stay just friends. That means no pressure or getting close to me. Just friends. You two got that?\" \nThey looked at each other like I was crazy but then looked back at me. \n\"We understand.\" Jordan said. \n\"Good.\" I said shocked. \n\"We won't pressure you or do anything to make you feel uncomfortable.\" Nile said. \n\"Okay, I'm glad we understand.\" \nI think that went pretty good. I'm proud of myself. \n\"I'll take your bags upstairs for you.\" Jordan said putting the bag over his shoulder that he was already holding and went upstairs. \nI sighed and followed. I walked down the hall. \n\"She's back!\" I heard someone say down the hall. \nI stopped and turned around someone came running up and hugged me. \n\"Oh I missed you.\" \nI know who it is. It's Gracie. I haven't seen her in a while. She let go of me and gave me a smile. \n\"I'm so glad you're back. I was excited when you first came and then you just up and left for four months. What's that all about?\" She said making her smile go away during her sentence. \n\"Oh, ha, yeah about that. Just a little vacation . . .\" I said making it up. But it was true. I was actually going to stay at Nick's until I was 18 but it turned out just to be a vacation. I ended up back here. \n\"Vampires aren't stupid. I know why you left. But don't worry; no one will harm you ever again.\" She said winking at me and put a smile back on her face. \n\"I'm glad.\" I said. \n\"I'll catch you later.\" She said and disappeared in a blink of an eye. \nI turned back around and I was guessing Jordan was in my room already because he wasn't there. I went down the hall and my door was open. \n\"All your stuff is put back.\" He said leaving my room. \n\"Huh? What?\" I said going in my room looking around. \nNothing was touched and just like Jordan said he put all my stuff back. He's fast . . . A little too fast. \n\"Thanks.\" I yelled to him. \n\"Yeah, no problem.\" He said half way down the hall. \nI shut my door. The smell in the air is so different from Nick's house. I can't really explain it. It's really sad . . . I actually - I actually missed this place. \nI woke up the next morning fully rested. I'm glad it's Christmas vacation. I don't have school all this week or next week. I'm happy. Its strange waking up in a different place. I'm so use to waking up at Nick's and now I'm here. I really never imagined I'd end up back here. Funny. \nI got up and took a shower before I went downstairs. After I opened up my door. Nile wasn't at the door like he usually is. Weird . . . Well, I can find my way to the dining room. That's probably where everyone else is anyway. I went downstairs and to the dining room. Everyone sat around talking. Some of the vampires looked over and some didn't. I still don't know everyone's name but I have a feeling I'll find out while I'm staying here. I went over and sat in my usual spot. Everyone still sits in the same place. I looked over at Jordan. \n\"Have a good night sleep?\" He asked. \nI breathed in. \"Yeah actually I did.\" \n\"I'm glad.\" \nIt got silent between us. It's still going to be a little awkward about the whole thing from yesterday but I don't care. If Nile and Jordan know how I feel that's all that matters. They won't bother me with it. \nI've been having a good day so far. I've been hanging out with all the vampires in the living room and they have been talking to me. More than they have before. It was comforting. Nick texted me earlier and asked how I was. He felt kind of bad that he was pressuring me but I said it was fine. I actually thought pressuring me was good. The more pressure the faster I'll decide. But I'm glad I chose the choice I did. I can always visit Autumn and Nick in Georgia. I'm positive Jordan would let me go and sleepover for a couple of days. \nI sat on the couch watching all the vampire guys play Call of Duty. I thought they played that last time. Whatever. I can see how guys react to this game. \n\"I totally got him!\" One basically screamed at the video game. \nOh gosh. It's a video game give me a break. \n\"Having fun?\" \nI looked over. Nile was looking at me. \n\"Yeah loads.\" I said sarcastic. \n\"This is how all the guys react to this game.\" He mentioned. \n\"I can see that.\" \n\"That's so not fair!\" Another screamed. \nI laughed. \n\"You think this is funny?\" The guy said angry. \nI stopped laughing and I got serious. \"No.\" I said \n\"Whoa, I'm just kidding.\" He said. \"You don't have to get all serious.\" \nThen why did you say it so angry idiot? \n\"Okay.\" I said. \nHe went back to playing his video game. \n\"That's how he acts all the time.\" Nile whispered to me. \n\"Um, yeah. I better get use to that . . .\" I whispered back. \n\"Hey, am I still invited to Nick's wedding?\" He asked. \n\"Of course.\" I said. \"Everyone is. I thought Nick told you.\" \n\"He did. I'm just making sure it's okay with you.\" \n\"Yeah, it's fine with me.\" \nNile jumped over the couch and sat next to me. \nFriday is the wedding. The day that Nick and Autumn get married. The next day they are moving to Georgia. That means, I'm not going to be able to go to Nick with all my problems. I have no choice but to stay here. There is no vacation away from vampires. These vampires are my new family. This is home \n\n\n"

Her mother died from a heart attack and her father died from a car accident. Her father told her that if anything happened to him go to that place where it would be saf... \n#bite #blood #florida #jordan #kiara #mansion #nick \nChapter 26 - Wedding \n\"Kiara, come on! We gotta get you to the church before nine.\" Nile yelled from out of my room. \nIt's Friday. Yep, that's right. The big day. \nI got my bag and walked out of my room. \n\"You're going to be late.\" \n\"No, I'm not. I told Autumn I would be there around nine. I never said I'd be on time.\" I said closing my door. \n\"What time does the wedding start?\" \n\"Two. I have to go over and help set up with things. The reception is at, I think three.\" \nWe walked down the hall. \n\"Ha, you have to stay there for five hours before the wedding starts.\" He said mocking me. \n\"Shut up . . . I won't be there the whole time. I have to go do some running around for Autumn.\" \n\"Do you have your camera?\" \n\"Of course. I wouldn't leave without it. I have to capture the memories.\" \nI went downstairs with Nile. \n\"I'll see you later.\" Jordan said before we went out the door. \n\"Okay. See you.\" I said. \nEverything is back to normal. It's been more normal than it has ever been. I haven't seen any sight of blood for a while. That's a good sign. All the vampires here have been treating me good. I hated the fact that my dad sent me here but, now . . . I'm kind of glad he did. \n\"See you at two.\" Nile said. \n\"Okay.\" I hopped down from the car and slammed the door. \nHe drove away. I walked in the church. All of Autumn's and Nick's friends were helping out today at the church. Putting up different things and stuff. They also have others helping with setting up the reception. That's going to be held at Autumn's father's house. He has a huge backyard. That's what's so perfect about it. \n\"Kiara.\" \nI looked over to my right. \n\"You finally made it. Come over here and help me.\" Autumn said. \nI went over. \n\"Okay, do me a favor and give this to Peter.\" She handed me a basket full of flowers. \nIsn't that supposed to go to a girl not a boy? You know, flower girl! \n\"Peter is down the hall over there.\" She pointed to the hall that was closest to us. \"The fourth room to your left. He has black hair.\" \n\"Okay.\" I said and was about to walk away. \n\"Oh and Kiara I have all your stuff ready for you in the room. Cindy will help you with your hair.\" \n\"Okay.\" I said again. \nSo who is Cindy? I don't know half of these people! The only ones I know are Nick's parents and Autumn's dad. I think Richard is coming. I still haven't seen him since that day he came over a long time ago, with blood on his shirt. \nI shivered at the thought of it. I put the thought aside and came to the fourth door on the left. The door was shut. I should probably knock before I walk in. I put my hand up to go knock. \n\"Come in.\" They said. \nI didn't even knock yet. I walked in the room. A man in stood in front of the mirror. He had short black hair. That must be Peter. A girl ran across the room and the man turned around. I gasped slightly. His skin white as snow and his fangs showed. I looked over at the girl she was human. \n\"You must be Kiara.\" He said walking up to me. He took the basket from my hands and gave it to the little girl next to him. \"Run along now.\" He said to the girl. \nThe girl with short brown hair ran away. \n\"I'm Peter.\" He said. \"I am Richard's brother.\" \nRichard's brother! I didn't know he had a brother. He looks nothing like him! \n\"Half brother I should say.\" He explained. \nHalf brother. Yeah that would explain it. \n\"Nice to meet you.\" I said. \n\"You know about our secret right?\" \n\"Of course.\" \n\"Then you already know we won't hurt you.\" \nI nodded. \nHe smiled with his white sharp teeth showing. \"I'm a good friend of Nick's.\" \n\"Oh.\" I said. \n\"I know a lot about you Kiara Hatake.\" \nHe probably does because he's a vampire. If every other vampire knows about me then he should know too. About my dad . . . and everything. \n\"Um, so you know everything about me?\" I asked. \n\"Most stuff.\" He said. \"Your father was a great man. You were lucky to have such a great father.\" \n\"Yeah, I was.\" \n\"I'd run along if I were you. Autumn probably wants you to go back.\" He suggested. \n\"Yeah, probably . . . Is Richard here yet?\" I asked. \n\"I think he will be coming in a little later.\" \n\"Okay, thanks.\" I walked away and I heard the door shut. \nThat was a little shocking. I guess I don't really know a lot about Richard. Funny . . . \nI went back to Autumn who was talking to someone. I walked up next to her. \n\"Ah, there you are Kiara. I need you to do me another favor.\" \nI've been here for not even ten minutes and she's already got me doing another job. I'm going to get so tired by the time the wedding starts. \nI sat on the couch in the dressing room watching all the girls help out Autumn with her hair and dress. Cindy helped me with my hair already. I guess she is a really good friend of Autumn's. They knew each other since they were really little. She has medium length hair and it's kind of a dark blonde color. She put my hair half up half down and let my bangs go to the side. She put little red clips in my hair to match with my dress. \nChristmas day. Yeah, this is how I want to spend my day. Watching all these girls freak out. I'm one of the bridesmaids out of five of them. But Autumn isn't really telling me what to do so I'm just sitting here. I'm a great bridesmaid. \n\"You look perfect.\" Cindy said. \nShe's the maid of honor. \n\"Do you really think so?\" Autumn said looking in the mirror. \n\"Yes, beautiful.\" She said. \n\"What do you think Kiara?\" Autumn said turning around at me. \n\"It's beautiful.\" I said. \nShe smiled. \"I'm so nervous.\" She said waving her hand to get some air on her. \"I'm sweating in this dress.\" \nToo bad it's not cool out for Christmas. I would have loved that. I looked over at the clock. It's about ten minutes to two. Not much time before the wedding starts. \n\n\n"

        "chapter_content": " Chapter One \n \n \nPaige took a seat in the tiny office of the local estate agent, the fat balding man sitting in front of her looked uncomfortable in the chair he was sitting on. He had only just about managed to squeeze into the matchbox he called his office, and she watched him as he dabbed the sweat on his brow with his handkerchief and then shakily put it back into his pocket. \nShe was there to buy the house on Victoria lane, the man had nearly died on the spot when she asked him about it, rushing her into his office as soon as he could. He told her all about it, how big it was, the price and what an investment it would be. She didn't need to hear it she had her mind set already and she was having it. There were only two houses on that road and it was just on the outskirts of the town but it looked peaceful. The house was a bargain for the size of it, she would have been a fool to miss an opportunity like that. \n\"Just sign on the dotted line and the house is yours,\" the eager estate agent told her. \nPaige rolled the pen between her fingers staring at the piece of paper in front of her, one signature and that dream house was hers. She looked up to see the estate agent staring at her almost desperately. She knew the house had been on the market a long time, but the way he was fidgeting around was making her think twice. \n\"Is there something wrong with this house?\" she asked curiously. \nShe watched as he fidgeted more and then quickly smiled at her, \"No of course not why do you ask?\" \n\"Oh it's just that it's such a nice house and it just seems a bit odd that no one else has shown any interest in it and I couldn't help but notice that you dropped the asking price quite substantially.\" she told him. \nThe man seemed to become nervous at her comment and quickly laughed it off. She passed the house every day on her way to work and had fallen in love with it, she wanted it, and it didn't really matter how nervous he seemed he wasn't going to put her off it. She had even made a call to her have her furniture delivered there. \n\"No no it's just that there is quite a lot of work to be done there.\" He reassured. \nPaige picked the pen back up and put it to the paper she gauged his reaction, she frowned dropping the pen when he looked relieved that she was going to sign. \n\"What about that house next door?\" she asked. \n\"What about it?\" The annoyance in his tone was evident and she raised her eyebrows. \n\"Tell me about it.\" She told him. \nHe put on the fakest smile he could muster up and nodded, \"That house is occupied, but the man who owns it prefers to keep himself to himself.\" \nPaige nodded and picked the pen back up and signed the paper, she had barely moved the pen when he snatched it up signing his part and handing her the keys. He could not wait to get rid of her that much was obvious as she picked the keys up and left without another word. \nShe jumped in her car and drove up to her new house, she sighed when she saw it, it needed so much work it looked like it was about to fall apart she just hoped the inside wasn't as bad. The front of the house was decrepit and the overgrowth in the garden was like a jungle. Getting out of her car she pushed at the gates, the iron groaned loudly as she forced them open. \nAfter what seemed like an eternity of sorting through which key went where she finally got the right one, and with one big push the door swung open. She opened the door and disturbed all of the dust that had settled, churning it up until she was choking and waving her hands around like someone insane trying to get it away from her. When the dust settled back down she smiled, it was not as bad as she thought it would be, the floors were beautiful and a bit of polish would bring them back up to what they once were. All it needed was some paint and cleaning and the house would be perfect she thought as she walked through the grand hallway and into the first of the two living rooms. \nShe went back out to her car, emptied it of the sweeping brush and mop, and got to work sweeping, dusting, and moping ready for her furniture to arrive. \nBy the time the deliverymen finally arrived, she had managed to clean the downstairs and her bedroom. The men put her bed together and as soon as they had gone, she flopped down onto it with a yawn. She was exhausted after all of that cleaning and it was getting late, she settled down in the bed and dropped off to sleep straight away. \nThe piercing sound of a scream woke her from her sleep in a panic, she bolted upright in bed and fiddled around for the switch to her bedside light. She looked around the room with wide eyes, almost expecting to see a spook, then the scream broke the silence again and that was when she realised it was coming from outside. \nShe jumped out of the bed, turned the light off and ran to the window. She stood at the window staring into the blackness, she could see into her neighbour's garden but she didn't notice anything unusual. \nThen as she was about to go back to bed she saw the back door open and a man with short messy black hair dragging something along, she carried on watching him as he picked the bundle up and threw it onto a pile of wood. She was watching her neighbour as he struck a match and then blew it out. She didn't have to wait long to see why he didn't light the fire as he turned around and looked straight up to the window. \nHe couldn't have seen her, there was no way, but as those dark eyes penetrated her she couldn't move. She froze too scared to move, as an uneasy feeling seemed to seep into her. He narrowed his eyes at her and then turned back to the fire, his muscular frame blocking the view of the bundle. He lit the fire, and with one last look at her window, he went back into his house. \nJust what was it that he was setting fire to at this hour she wondered as she looked at the clock on her bedside table, it was one in the morning. Something else was bothering her though, the way he had looked up at her window and acted as though he could see her when there was no way it was possible. It was too dark and he was too far away to have seen her she was just being ridiculous. \nHow could he have seen her? Where did that scream come from and who was the mysterious man next door? \n\n\n"

The sound of her phone ringing made her jump and she nearly spilt her coffee over herself, she grabbed it and answered. \n\u201cOh yeah hi, yeah I\u2019m fine thanks. I was just hoping you could send someone over to take a look at my garden.\u201d \nShe had called the local landscape gardeners, because there was no way she could tackle it herself it was too big and way too out of control. She had booked some time off work, so that she could get her new house in some sort of order, but gardening was not something she enjoyed and she would rather pay someone to do it for her. She gulped the last few dregs of her coffee down and grimaced at the coldness and bitterness of it. \nThe man on the phone had said that someone would be with her shortly, she was surprised when her door knocked less than an hour later, she was impressed to say the least she was expecting to have to wait all day. She opened the front door to the gardener and smiled at him, he was easy on the eye she was expecting some fat old man, but he was young, fit and handsome. \n\u201cHi\u201d she smiled. \n\u201cHey, I\u2019m Zak. Show me this jungle.\u201d He said with a laugh. \nShe smirked at him, he wouldn\u2019t be laughing when he saw the state of it, she led him through to the kitchen and opened the doors that led to the garden. She giggled when she saw the look of disbelief on his face, but when he turned around and walked back to the front of the house she thought that was his way of saying he wasn\u2019t doing it. She was relieved to see him start unloading his van. \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take me a while, at least a month. I\u2019ve never seen a mess like it\u201d he told her. \nShe nodded in agreement there was no argument there, it was more than a mess. She made him a drink and got on with some painting whilst he started the garden. \nZak was cutting down some of the trees in the garden when he caught a glimpse of Paige standing on a chair, struggling to reach the wall she was painting. She looked so adorable in a t-shirt that looked four sizes too big for her, he smirked as she leaned across stretching her long legs giving him a great view. He chuckled as she missed the spot that she was aiming for again and decided to go in and ask if she needed his help. \n\u201cDo you want me to do that for you?\u201d he asked walking in the room. \nShe was startled at the sound of his voice and she wobbled on the chair, letting out a little scream as she fell off the chair but the bump she was expecting never came as Zak caught her, they both landed in a heap on the floor. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d he chuckled, they were both covered in the paint that she had been balancing on the chair. \n\u201cNo I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve ruined your clothes!\u201d She gasped seeing the paint dripping off his shirt. \n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, it\u2019s a work shirt anyway.\u201d He informed her. \nPaige offered to wash it for him, and couldn\u2019t hide her blushes as he peeled it off and passed it to her without an argument. She stood staring at his chest for a while until his laugh brought her back to her senses. \n\u201cI\u2019ll just go and get this washed,\u201d she told him hurrying out of the room to save herself any more embarrassment. \nZak walked into her kitchen and sat down while she made him another drink and something to eat, her way of apologising for covering him in paint. \n\u201cI should really get on with that garden, I\u2019m sure your boyfriend wouldn\u2019t be impressed to find a half naked man in your kitchen.\u201d \nPaige started to laugh and shook her head nearly choking on her coffee. Boyfriend? What had given him that idea, she had no time for men, she didn\u2019t mind a bit of fun. She wasn\u2019t one for commitment and settling down she was still only twenty, and she certainly wasn\u2019t ready for a serious relationship. \n\u201cOh I haven\u2019t got a boyfriend, no thanks I\u2019m happy as I am.\u201d She giggled. \nZak was pleased, there was hope there that he could get in her knickers because that\u2019s all he wanted, he didn\u2019t do long term relationships either. One thing he couldn\u2019t bear was clingy women that demanded his attention all of the time, no way, he liked his mates and drinking too much. \n\u201cOh right, that\u2019s cool I suppose. This is a big house to be rattling around in on your own though don\u2019t you think?\u201d he questioned. \nPaige had never really seen it that way, it was an investment for her future. She wasn\u2019t ruling out a family altogether and it seemed like the perfect use of the money her parents had left her. She had been holding onto it since she was eighteen it\u2019s what they had left her in their will. \nShe had moved there to get away from the painful memories of her old town, everywhere she turned there were constant reminders of her parents and it haunted her. It wasn\u2019t that she wanted to forget them, but they had died in a car crash right in the middle of town, and with it being a small place people always pitied her and she felt as though she couldn\u2019t move on. \n\u201cNot really, I fell in love with this house so it made sense.\u201d she said sharply. \nZak bit his bottom lip, maybe he shouldn\u2019t have asked, he didn\u2019t know the girl it really was none of his business it wasn\u2019t as if they were friends. \u201cSorry I shouldn\u2019t pry,\u201d he told her a little embarrassed at her reaction. \n\u201cNo, that was rude of me,\u201d she told him. \nThe click of the washing machine door saved them both from the awkwardness that had just filled the room, she jumped up to grab it, and left the room to put it in the tumble dryer. She went straight back to her painting and left him sitting in the kitchen, not able to face him after she snapped at him. \nZak grabbed his shirt from the tumble dryer when it had finished and carried on with the trees, it was going dark outside though and he hardly had any work done. Looking over at the house next door he felt a cold chill run through his body, the sun setting over the hill was casting an orange glow across the house, and there was something eerie about it. He shuddered and quickly made his way into the house. \n\u201cHey, who lives next door?\u201d He asked Paige when he saw her washing her paintbrushes in the sink. \nShe turned to face him and looked a little worried, \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d \n\u201cOh I just thought there could be some more work around here for me,\u201d he lied. \nShe shrugged and carried on, sensing she wasn\u2019t going to elaborate he quickly said goodbye, and made his way out of her house. She was hard to work out, he was usually quite good at reading people but she didn\u2019t give a lot away. \nPaige felt guilty at how she had been with him, she had been quite rude again, he had only asked a question and she couldn\u2019t understand why she didn\u2019t just tell him that a man lived there and she didn\u2019t know him. She locked the front and back door and settled down on the sofa to watch some TV, she was watching some crappy reality show and could feel her eyelids growing heavy, but just as she was nodding off she heard a scream again. \nShe rushed to the front door and opened it, listening carefully she realised that it was coming from next door. She couldn\u2019t ignore it any longer so she rushed inside and called the police. \n\u201cHello what\u2019s your emergency?\u201d the operator asked. \n \n \n\u201cI need the police please, it\u2019s my next door neighbour, I\u2019ve heard screaming coming from there for two days now. Something is not right! Yes my address is Two Victoria lane and his is number one.\u201d she told them. \n\u201cSomeone will be right over miss, do not go near the house miss, please wait for the police.\u201d The operator told her. \n \n\n\n"

She didn\u2019t really have a good look at him the night before, but she could see him now and he was the sexiest man she had ever seen. He was tall and slim, with broad shoulders and short black hair, she couldn\u2019t see the colour of his eyes, because thankfully he had turned around so that she was now looking at his strong broad shoulders. \n \nThe officers followed him into his house and before he went in after them he turned and faced the window that she was looking through and smirked at her, she was sure in that moment she had seen a flash of fangs. She was reading way too much into this, fangs, screaming women, she was in some desperate need of some sleep, and to top it off he had seen her spying on him again. He must have had seriously good eyesight to be able to see her through the window again; it wasn\u2019t even like she had the lights on. \nTurning around she traipsed up the stairs, if there was something wrong then the police would sort it out, she had done all she needed to do. She went up to her bedroom, turned the light on and went to draw the curtains, but was surprised to see the police leaving already. The two officers were laughing and joking with her neighbour, and then they got into their car and left, she felt like a fool she had obviously wasted their time, what an idiot she was, calling the police when clearly there was nothing wrong, he probably just liked to watch the TV loud. \nShe shut the curtains before he saw her again and pulled a nightdress on, climbing into bed, and settling down she turned her TV, but just as she was getting into the film that had just started her front door knocked. She frowned and got out of bed wondering who it could be at that time of night, she pulled her dressing gown and made her way down the winding staircase to the front door. \nPaige opened the front door and gasped when she saw her neighbour standing on her doorstep looking far from impressed, but that wasn\u2019t what she noticed first, no it was those eyes. She had never seen eyes that shade of blue in her life they were beautiful and she couldn\u2019t tear her eyes away from them. \n\u201cDo you make a habit of calling the police out to your neighbours?\u201d his deep voice dragged her attention back to the fact that he was standing there expecting an answer. \nPaige felt her cheeks heat up at his question, she hadn\u2019t made a very good first impression, he was her only neighbour and she had called the police on him and it was only her second day there. Then she got annoyed with herself, he hadn\u2019t made a very good impression either, burning things in the middle of the night and then there were the un-explainable screams that came from his house. \n\u201cNot usually, I thought I\u2019d try something different,\u201d she told him sarcastically. \nSeth remained expressionless, even though he was mildly amused by the human woman standing in front of him. He thought she was foolish to open the door at that time of night to a man she didn\u2019t know, she deserved to be killed and he was going to enjoy hearing her screams. \n\u201cYou really should be more careful about who you open the door to,\u201d he told her, with a flash of fangs again. \nShe was worried that time, she had definitely seen two very sharp teeth then, there was no doubt in her mind, she panicked and tried to shut the front door, but he had his foot in the way. The door bounced back open, and she didn\u2019t have time to run as he pounced on her and they fell to the floor with a thud. \nThe force of her hip hitting the floor made her groan loudly, but he didn\u2019t seem to care that he had hurt her, and was licking her neck as though it was coated in something sweet, the feeling of his warm mouth on her neck made her moan, it felt so good. Her heart was pounding and she could feel the pulse that he was licking throbbing against his warm tongue, she was just inviting him to bite her she thought angrily as her fight mode suddenly kicked back in, and she pushed, punched and pinched trying to get him off her. It was no use though, and to add insult to injury he just seemed amused by her attempts to stop his attack. \u201cGet off me you lunatic!\u201d she screamed, pounding her fists against his chest. \nSeth was bored of their little game now, and he bit down into her neck, but the second her blood flowed into his expectant mouth he jumped up and hissed as though she had burnt him. \nPaige watched him as he wiped the blood from his mouth, and backed away from her as though she was the monster. His expression wasn\u2019t the same as when he attacked her, there was no malice there, those eyes weren\u2019t mocking her anymore. He almost looked pained? Shocked? Horror struck? She couldn\u2019t put her finger on what it was, but he was backing away as if he was about to make a run for it. \n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you kill me?\u201d she asked, her voice wavering. \nHis hand hovered over the door handle and as he turned around, she shuffled backwards, he took a step forward and her back hit the bottom of the stairs, she pushed herself up so that she was standing and looked him straight in the eye. He couldn\u2019t look at her now, and it puzzled her, he was looking down at the floor, and if she was right, he looked ashamed of himself. \n\u201cStay away from me,\u201d he whispered, turning around and walking back to the front door. \n\u201cHang on a minute, you can\u2019t just come in here, bite me like some wild animal then ask me to stay away from you!\u201d she knew probably shouldn\u2019t have been talking to him like that, but she had never been one to back down. \n \nSeth turned to face her and that time he looked her straight in the eyes, he glared at her, and he could see her squirming under his gaze, he had always seen humans as pathetic and pitiful, but there was something about her, something intriguing. She was showing him no fear even after he had bitten her, his victims were usually begging him not to kill them, but not her. \n\u201cI said stay away from me, because next time I will not think twice about ripping your throat out!\u201d he warned. \nHe was gone before she could give him an answer, and she quickly ran to the front door and slammed it shut. She looked at her neck in the mirror; he hadn\u2019t even sunk his fangs in that deep, just enough to pierce the skin, and the blood she was expecting wasn\u2019t there. What was thinking? Never mind that, he had bitten her, an actual vampire, she was living next door to a real vampire, which explained why the house was so cheap, she cursed. She bolted the front door and searched the house for a weapon to take to bed with her, in case he came back and decided to finish her. \n \n \nVote, comment Fan :) \n\n\n"

She lay in bed clutching her makeshift stake, she had made it from a chair leg, but it wasn\u2019t like she would stand a chance against him, he\u2019d already proved how strong he was, but she was damned if she would go down without a fight that wasn\u2019t her. She was a fighter until the end, as gruesome as that end could be. \nWhat she didn\u2019t understand is how a vampire could go unnoticed for so long, if that\u2019s what he even was, she had just guessed from the fangs, lightning speed and beauty of him that he was not of this world, but another more sinister one that she had somehow stumbled upon. She finally drifted off to sleep as the light broke through her window; she was at ease now knowing that if the stories about vampires were true he couldn\u2019t strike during the day. \nIf she thought, her sleep was going to be peaceful she was in for a shock, as she had some of the most horrific and disturbing dreams, she had ever experienced. Death was everywhere, bloodshed and murder, she was merely a witness to a time that she had only read about, it must have been Victorian times if the clothes the people wore were anything to go by. She was in a house that resembled her own, it was her house she realised, just in another time, everything was laid out the same only there was no electricity, and the gas lamps that adorned the walls of the house gave an eerie glow against the cold stonewalls. \nShe walked down the grand staircase, and saw a woman and a man having what looked like was an intense argument. They couldn\u2019t see her as she stood next to them trying to listen to what their argument was about. It was as the man turned around that she froze, it was him, the man from next door. He looked just as young and beautiful as he had been when she saw him last night in her house, the woman looked terrified as he bared his fangs at her and sank his teeth into her neck. He showed no compassion as she screamed and writhed around in his arms, it only seemed to make him become more vicious as she struggled against the iron grip he had on her body. He bit down savagely into her neck, tearing through her skin with such ease, and as the blood soaked into the white corset she wore, it sickened Paige. \nHe reared his head back, his beautiful blue eyes, glowing red through the blood he had consumed, and he looked every bit the monster he was. He dropped the woman to the floor with such callousness, and stepped over her wiping her blood from his mouth. Paige watched as he knelt down next to her, and put a finger under her chin angling her face up to his, her eyes were dull and she was struggling for breath. \n\u201cBeg for mercy,\u201d he demanded with a cruel smile. \n\u201cNever!\u201d she choked, blood spilling from her neck and mouth, soaking into the floorboards beneath her. \nWith that, he smirked and with one rough twist, he snapped her neck ending her life. What a horrible way to die, alone and at the hands of such an evil being. He slid a ring from her finger, a beautiful gold band with one small diamond in the centre. It was as though Paige could see into his mind, it was a token of his kill, he took something from his victims, as though to remind himself of how much power he held, a reminder of how weak and pathetic the humans he killed were. \nPaige woke from the dream with a gasp; she wondered whether it was a warning from the woman whose house this once was, a warning to get out while she still could. She had been lucky that he hadn\u2019t killed her while he had the chance. That was another thing she couldn\u2019t understand, the way he drank from that woman so hungrily, and yet when he had bit her it seemed like he was disgusted by the taste of her blood. \nShe dragged herself out of bed to answer the front door, whoever it was had no patience. She opened the door ready to rip shreds off who it was and was greeted by an overly chirpy Zak. \n\u201cMorning!\u201d he said cheerfully. \nShe let him inside and stormed into the kitchen, Zak frowned she obviously wasn\u2019t a morning person, he thought as he watched her slamming cupboard doors and banging about. He looked at the clock, it was ten he was actually an hour late, yet she looked like she had just rolled out of bed herself and obviously hadn\u2019t noticed his lateness. \n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d He asked she looked pale. \n\u201cI\u2019m fine why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d She snapped, of course she wasn\u2019t alright she had been a witness to a murder that had happened a lifetime ago, but it wasn\u2019t like she could say anything about it. \nZak huffed and walked out into the garden, she was going to be difficult to work for, maybe he should pass the job on to someone else. She opened the back door, handed him a coffee, and smiled at him, it wasn\u2019t his fault and she had no right to take out on him. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t sleep,\u201d she told him apologetically. \nNow he could see her in the sun he could tell, she had bags under her eyes and looked stressed out and exhausted. He nodded and took the coffee from her; he wondered whether it was worth the risk asking why she hadn\u2019t slept. She might have had a man round last night and that\u2019s why she was sleeping in late. \n\u201cAny particular reason why you didn\u2019t sleep?\u201d he asked her boldly, knowing that she was probably going to tell him to piss off. \n\u201cI had a bit of a run in with my neighbour and it played on my mind all night,\u201d she confessed, she wasn\u2019t about to tell him exactly what she had seen though. \nZak raised his eyebrows, \u201cWhat was it about?\u201d \nShe sighed, \u201cI called the police, there was noise coming from there turns out it was nothing, and well he wasn\u2019t very happy about it.\u201d \nZak didn\u2019t like what he was hearing, who did this man think he was? Going round to her house when she lived alone. He didn\u2019t like bullies and if they had a run last night and she hadn\u2019t slept because of it, he must have scared her. \u201cDo you want me to go round there? I\u2019ll put him in his place he won't bother you again.\u201d he offered. \nPaige resisted the urge to laugh; he wouldn\u2019t open the door during the day, and if he could Zak wouldn\u2019t come out of there alive. She shook her head at him and smiled. \u201cNo it\u2019s fine, I can handle myself but thanks anyway.\u201d She told him. \n\u201cWell if he does it again let me go round okay?\u201d \nPaige nodded again not wanting to talk about it further; it wasn\u2019t like he could actually do anything. She left him to his gardening while she went upstairs to try to get some more sleep. When she woke up again she felt refreshed she hadn\u2019t had any more nightmares, which she was glad of. She tied her in a ponytail, and was just about to go downstairs when she caught sight of her reflection in the mirror, the two fang marks were an angry red, she quickly untied her hair and strategically placed her hair over the offending area. \n \nZak had cleared a big space of trees, but there was still a lot of work to remaining, he smiled when Paige walked into the garden looking fresher than she had that morning. She sat down and closed her eyes as the sun shone down on her face, and he couldn\u2019t resist it, with the hosepipe in his hand, he turned the water on and soaked her. \nShe screamed and jumped up, the water was dripping down on her furious face and Zak regretted it as soon as he had done it, as she stormed into the house looking far from impressed. He was such an idiot what a childish thing to do, he was still kicking himself and hadn\u2019t noticed that she had come back into the garden, she tapped him on the shoulder and when he turned around he got a face full of ice cold water. \n\n\n"

He would always be there to make sure she was safe after all that is all he could offer her. It wasn\u2019t as though it was her fault she was destined to be with a vampire, and it wouldn\u2019t be fair on her to drag her into a world that he had never wanted to be part of in the first place. \nHe looked out of the window and saw her standing in the same spot he had left her in, she hadn\u2019t moved she looked like a statue. He had rejected her and he had no problem with that, but she was still a hindrance to him, because he still felt the need to look after her. \nOpening his back door he went back to her, not able to stay away, he was drawn to her, her soft voice, mesmerising eyes and beautiful face had made him weak the second he had seen her. He stopped in front of her and looked down at her she was dazed; no doubt, the shock of being attacked by a demon had sunk in. \n\u201cCome with me,\u201d he told her extending his hand to her. \nPaige looked up startled by the sound of his deep voice and without thinking placed her hand in his for the second time that night. He took her to his house and shut the door behind them. \nShe was awestruck by his house it was beautiful, his living room looked warm and inviting, no doubt to lull his victims into a false sense of security before he struck. She sat down on his sofa and stared at him as he poured something red into a glass, she felt sick at the realisation it was probably blood. \n\u201cIts wine,\u201d he told her handing it to her, \u201cI prefer my blood a little fresher.\u201d \nShakily she took the wine from him, as their hands brushed she shuddered and dropped the glass, but with his inhuman speed he caught it before it hit the creamy carpet below. \n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to kill you,\u201d he reassured. \nHis tone was different to what she had heard before, it was soft and gentle and she found herself smiling at him as he put the glass down in front of her. \n\u201cI\u2019m sure you have questions,\u201d he muttered relaxing back into the big leather chair opposite her. \nThe very fact she was sitting in the same room as the vampire that had attempted to kill her only a few nights ago seemed to evade her, she looked at him in wonder he was actually going to let her question him. \n\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d she whispered. \nOf all the questions, she could ask, she asks such a human thing, he thought with a smirk, \u201cSeth.\u201d \n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you let that thing kill me?\u201d \nSeth was thrown by her question he was expecting her to ask him about being a vampire, or how old he was, but it seemed she wanted to know more about what had happened tonight. \n\u201cIt would have possessed you, you would have died eventually but the pain you would have felt would have been like nothing you could ever imagine.\u201d He revealed. \nPaige sighed, it still didn\u2019t make sense why would he care if she suffered, it wasn\u2019t that she wanted to die but since she had found out about vampires, she was seeing things differently. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d She asked him, swishing the wine around in her glass. \n\u201cThat\u2019s not an easy thing to explain, but all of those things you did when you were human become tedious, you see the world is a more beautiful place through the eyes of a vampire, you humans spend all your life fighting each other and not appreciating the beauty of the world and then you die, it\u2019s pathetic.\u201d \nIt might have been pathetic to him, but it wasn\u2019t for her she was living her life how she wanted to, and she wasn\u2019t bored of it, she didn\u2019t believe she was missing out on anything. \n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong about us being pathetic,\u201d she snapped. \nSeth raised his eyebrows and went to speak but she interrupted him. \n\u201cYou see we have something you don\u2019t, love!\u201d she hissed. \nSeth growled at that, if only she knew he thought furiously, he was capable of love she was clear proof of that, because he had never given it a second thought about killing anyone. He had killed so many beautiful women and it hadn\u2019t bothered him in the slightest, but she was a puzzle to him. \n\u201cYou know nothing about vampires, nothing at all,\u201d he told her harshly. \n\u201cI don\u2019t want to know anything about them!\u201d she snapped, it was true she wanted to go back to her life before she knew about them. \nWith a blink of an eye, he was licking her neck, and biting down over the wounds he had already left. She gripped onto the back of his shirt trying to stop him, but the pain she expected was gone and was replaced with a warm feeling. It was almost tender the way he was holding her as he drank her blood, she could feel her head spinning as a result of the blood loss and then he reared back and was gone. He was pacing around by the window leaving her overcome with a feeling of coldness. \nEvery now and then he would glance at her, he had gone too far, he shouldn\u2019t have brought her into his home; he had put temptation there, and tempt him she had. He needed her like he needed blood, and he hated that feeling more than anything he had ever felt. It wasn\u2019t just her blood he wanted though now he was yearning for her body he wanted to feel that soft skin beneath him, wanted to touch her, bite her, he wanted to make her beg him to take her. \nPaige touched the wound on her neck, but there was no blood there he must have healed it again she thought as she looked over at him, he looked conflicted about something, as was she. Was he trying to prove a point about how supreme his kind were she wondered, but it wasn\u2019t that it was something else bothering her, the way it had felt so good when he touched her. \n\u201cYou need to leave,\u201d he told her firmly, if she didn\u2019t get out he was going to lose control and turn her. \nVote, comment Fan :) \n \n\n\n"

He could have easily caught her, but he let her run. \nThe sound of Zak singing out of tune brought her back round from her daydreaming and she shielded her eyes from the blinding sun to look at him. This was how she spent her time of late; lying on the bench trying to get a tan, whilst he worked on the garden, and thankfully it was starting to look like a garden again. \n\u201cYour singing is awful!\u201d she told him honestly. \nZak shut up and looked at her with a smirk, \u201cOh lady muck is awake!\u201d \n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d she said with a giggle. \nThey had been getting on well and he had taken to calling her lady muck, because all she did while he worked was lounge around sipping iced drinks and sunbathing, and why not she had taken some time off work to relax. \n\u201cYou were snoring like a pig!\u201d He told her with a straight face. \n\u201cI do not snore!\u201d She hissed sitting up and looking around with a yawn. \n\u201cYou do talk in your sleep though,\u201d he said sitting down on the bench next to her. \n\u201cWhat was I saying?\u201d She asked curiously. \n\u201cYou kept saying the name Seth?\u201d He said cheekily sipping her drink. \nPaige froze and then smiled, \u201cHow strange.\u201d \nZak shrugged and stood up stretching out; Paige tilted her head to the side noticing a tattoo on his shoulder that she had never spotted before. \n\u201cWhat is that supposed to be?\u201d She asked touching it. \nIt was an odd-looking symbol with intricate swirls around it, \u201cOh I don\u2019t know I just liked it.\u201d \nSomething told her that he knew exactly what it meant, but she didn\u2019t press the matter any further and lay back down on the bench. Zak lifted her head up and sat down dropping her head back in his lap. \n\u201cFancy a drink tonight?\u201d He asked moving her hair from her face. \nThey had become quite close over the last few days and she had opened up to him quite a bit, \u201cYeah if you want to.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019ll cook if you want me to,\u201d he offered. \n\u201cAre you sure you can cook, I don\u2019t want food poisoning.\u201d She laughed. \nZak huffed at her, \u201cMaybe lady muck should cook for herself then.\u201d \n** \nSeth was lying on his bed; listening to them, he was tired of hearing their flirting it made him feel sick. Knowing that Zak\u2019s intention was to get her into bed only made things worse, and she was falling for his charms. \nHe could kill him, get him out of the way, the thought of him having her affection was something that wound him up no end. He couldn\u2019t have her but he was damn sure he wouldn\u2019t allow that pitiful excuse of a man to have her. \nThe way she giggled at him and teased him was sickening, he couldn\u2019t see what it was they were doing out there but he was sure that he had his filthy hands all over her, tainting what belonged to him. \nRolling over on the bed with a sigh, he had to face reality. He couldn\u2019t condemn her to a life of loneliness just because he didn\u2019t want anyone else to have her. Why shouldn\u2019t she feel love and have a normal human life with children. He had just convinced himself that Zak was wrong for her, and that his intentions were not honourable, but then the more he thought about it, the more he realised he was going to be like it whenever she met a man. \n\u201cGod damn you!\u201d He hissed to himself when he heard her giggling again. \nWhat were they doing out there? Why was she giggling like that, he so desperately wanted to see what was going on, it was almost worth burning to death just to see how beautiful she looked in the sunlight. \nHe wasn\u2019t going to get any sleep with them out there, he needed to rest though, he was erratic without sleep it had never been a good mix, he tended to go on killing sprees when he had been without sleep it heightened his lust for blood. If he didn\u2019t rest, he would hurt her, the first place he would go was round to her house, and he couldn\u2019t let that happen. \nHe paced around in the basement of his house for hours, he needed to go away for a few days to try and clear her out of his mind, because at this moment in time he was ready to go up there and rip that prick to shreds and claim her. \n** \n \n \nPaige was putting the rubbish out while Zak was cooking dinner and as she reached the end of the drive, she noticed a piece of paper stuck between the bars of her gate. Pulling the paper away, she opened it up and didn\u2019t understand what it meant, it looked like it had been ripped out of a book and to make matters worse it was in Latin. \nShe took the piece of paper inside and shoved it in her pocket deciding against showing it to Zak. Who the hell was she going to get to translate Latin to her, there was only one person who could possibly have an inkling to what it meant and he had told her to keep away from him. \n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Zak shouted from the kitchen. \n\u201cI\u2019m just taking the rubbish out!\u201d She shouted back, needing an excuse to leave the house again. \nShe grabbed a pen and some paper from her handbag and quickly scribbled a note on it and pushed it through Seth\u2019s front door. Then she ran back to her house, scared that he would be furious if he caught her there. \nZak was serving their dinner up when she got back into the house and she took a seat at the table and started to eat it, she was surprised at how nice it was and gave him a thumbs up which he just chuckled at. \n\u201cThis is really good,\u201d she said licking her lips. \n\u201cI know it is, I can cook you know,\u201d he told her biting into his own steak. \n\u201cOh my god how can you eat it when there is that much blood coming from it?\u201d \nZak shrugged and carried on eating it, he should have cooked it a little more he didn\u2019t want her becoming suspicious of him, couldn\u2019t risk exposing himself for what he truly was. The human side of him was falling for her, but the other side he was fighting with, because the other side wanted to tear her apart. \n \nVote comment fan :) \n \n\n\n"

What part of stay away did that girl not understand? \nHe walked to the front door and grabbed the piece of paper that was wedged in his letter box. Opening it up he frowned, she was asking for his help to translate something, he opened up the second piece of paper and his curiosity grew, It was in Latin, the dead language how could she think he would know what it meant he had never learnt Latin, but as he looked at the symbols on the paper something struck him, it was about demons that much he did know. \nHe couldn\u2019t help her with it and was about to throw it away when his protectiveness of her got the better of him. He knew someone who would be able to translate, but that person was someone he didn\u2019t have any desire to speak to, someone he had avoided for a very long time. \n\u201cTime to wake up old friend,\u201d he muttered, leaving the house and heading for the local cemetery. \nHe jumped over the wall to the cemetery and weaved his way through crumbling and collapsing gravestones, until he finally came to the place he had tried to forget about. It was hardly noticeable from the roadside, with the vines and moss that crept up the side of the crypt. The crypt itself stood alone away from the graves of the people that were actually dead looking neglected and worn through the years of bad weather. \nHe slid the door open with ease and scrunched his nose up in disgust at the smell of the place. Water dripped from the ceiling and onto the cold stone floor, making it look every bit as undesirable as it was. Finally deciding he had no choice, he opened the coffin and grimaced at the sight of the corpse, the shrivelled disgusting corpse of Marcus. \nBiting down into his wrist he dripped some blood into his mouth and stepped back waiting for it to take effect. He leaned against the wall and watched and waited, a groan coming from the coffin had him lifting his head up in wonder. \n\u201cWhat year is it?\u201d Marcus rasped, sitting up, his skin was smoothing out and his hollow eyes were taking on their usual moss green. \n\u201cTwenty-twelve, we might need you to get you some new clothes,\u201d he muttered looking over at a now fresh faced Marcus. \n\u201cI tasted something in your blood,\u201d he told him curiously. \nSeth knew what he had tasted, but Marcus was an old romantic,  he loved the idea of mates and all that crap, so he was no threat to her. \n\u201cYou found her?\u201d he said climbing out of the coffin and stretching. \n\u201cI have no desire to make her mine, if that is what you are asking.\u201d He thought he would end it before he started going all mushy on him, for a vampire he sure was soft. \n\u201cWhat have you woken me for?\u201d he asked cracking his neck, his long black hair cascading over his shoulders and his green eyes shimmering in the moonlight. \n\u201cI need something translating, it\u2019s in Latin and it is something to do with her,\u201d he sighed. \nMarcus\u2019s eyes flashed with amusement, \u201cYou woke me up to read something? I\u2019m so hurt I thought you had missed me?\u201d he mocked. \n\u201cJust read it for me please and cut the crap, you know me, you know I have never, and will never have any desire for a companion. I don\u2019t know how I put up with you for as long as I did.\u201d \n\u201cI often ask myself the same question, why did I change a vampire that was so damn moody?\u201d Marcus mocked snatching the piece of paper from him. \nMarcus read over the piece of paper then put it into his shirt pocket, \u201cWe feed first then talk later.\u201d \nSeth knew he was going to do that, that\u2019s what infuriated him the most, Marcus knew exactly what the note said, but he was always one to play games, he just guessed that it wasn\u2019t anything too bad because Marcus wouldn\u2019t want Paige in any danger, not knowing what she was to him. \n\u201cSo come on then boy take me to the ladies.\u201d Marcus chirped. \n\u201cDressed like that?\u201d he asked in shock and horror, he looked like he had just walked out of a fancy dress shop. \n\u201cOh ok we will go back to your house and I can change into something a little more up to date,\u201d he groaned. \nThey got back to his house and walked inside and Marcus stopped and sniffed the air, \u201cDemon?\u201d \n\u201cI killed one the other night, what of it?\u201d Seth asked closing the door behind him. \n\u201cNo this one is fresh, alive and close by,\u201d Marcus informed him. \nSeth couldn\u2019t smell anything, \u201cI don\u2019t smell it!\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s a very old demon, very good at hiding it\u2019s scent,\u201d he told him. \nMarcus had a better sense for demons than Seth, because of his age he could smell them a mile off. He pulled the piece of paper from his shirt pocket and read over it again. \n\u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d he asked motioning to the note. \nIt was an entry from the book of Daris, the book of demons, this particular page was about a specific type of demon, a strong demon. One that could take on the form of a human, one that was very good at mind trickery. \n\u201cPaige pushed it through my door earlier,\u201d he told him. \nHe saw something cross Marcus\u2019s face and before he knew what was happening Marcus was out of the door and banging on Paige\u2019s door. \n\u201cWhat are you doing!\u201d Seth shouted, pulling him back, but it was too late as she opened the door. \n\u201cSeth?\u201d She whispered looking between him and the strangely dressed vampire beside him. \n\u201cAre you alone?\u201d Marcus asked. \nShe nodded her head, Zak had gone over an hour ago and she was getting ready for bed when the door knocked, she watched as the man seemed relieved that she was alone and frowned at him. \n\u201cYou stay with her I\u2019ve got somewhere I have to be,\u201d Marcus told him, before Seth could protest he spoke again, \u201cShe is in serious danger, don\u2019t go anywhere until I get back.\u201d \nPaige\u2019s eyes widened, what had she missed here, \u201cWait is someone going to explain?\u201d \nSeth pushed her inside the house, giving Marcus a glare, \u201cIf this is one of your games I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d \n \nPaige tried to get another look at the oddly dressed man on her doorstep but Seth was shoving her inside the house and closing the door, he leaned against the door regarding her coldly, keeping his distance from her. \n\u201cWhere\u2019s lover boy?\u201d he hissed, looking towards the stairs he knew he wasn\u2019t there but the fact that he had been still wound him up. \n\u201cHe\u2019s not here and he is not my lover, not that it is any of your business!\u201d \nWhat was wrong with this vampire, one minute he was attacking her, the next he was kissing her then he was acting almost jealous of her gardener. \n\u201cThat\u2019s a shame I was feeling peckish.\u201d He smirked flashing his fangs at her, she shuddered at the sight of them. \nHis eyes glistened in the light from outside and her breath caught in her throat, they were so beautiful, she had never really studied his face before, but now he was standing in front of her she could admire his beauty. \u201cIt\u2019s rude to stare,\u201d he told her, he felt uncomfortable under her gaze. \n\u201cSorry,\u201d she mumbled, she rushed past him into her bedroom and he followed her curious to see where she was going. \nHe smirked when he saw her trying to hide something and took it from her with a chuckle, \u201cIs this for my benefit?\u201d \nHe ran his hand down the smooth wood of the stake she had obviously made and smirked. He watched as her cheeks flushed pink, embarrassed at being caught with her weapon, the weapon she had made to kill him. \n\u201cI thought...\u201d she stuttered, she shut up as he took the stake and traced the edge of her nightdress and dragged it down, lightly pressing it against her pounding heart. He flipped it around and opened his shirt so that it was pressing against his heart, and wrapped her shaking hands around it, \u201cDo it,\u201d he whispered. \nShe was shaking so much, and she gasped as it scraped his skin, drawing blood, it trickled down his firm chest, and she watched in amazement as the scratch disappeared before her eyes. He took the stake from her and threw it onto the bed with a sigh, she opened her mouth to speak, but didn\u2019t get the chance as his mouth was on hers, kissing her with so much passion she thought her knees were going to give way. He cupped the back of her neck with his hand and deepened the kiss, dominating it, he became rougher as his lust for her took over, and she hissed as his fangs caught her lip. Seth groaned as her warm, sweet tasting blood dripped into his mouth, and with one soft push she landed on the bed behind them, he climbed on top of her kissing her neck finding her pulse point and gently sucking on it, warming the skin, but just as he was about to bite in he sensed Marcus was back. \nHe moved away from her angry with himself and his lack of self control, he stood by the window looking out, when he saw Marcus coming back he slid the window open and stopped to look at her. \n\u201cIf I were you I\u2019d keep that stake sharp. Don\u2019t expect any more visits like this, next time I come I expect you to use that thing,\u201d he said pointing to the stake that was now on her bed and then he was gone. \nVote, comment Fan :) \n\n\n"

She was still in shock when he came at her the way he did, she thought he was going to attack her, but the way he had kissed her had blown her mind. Never in her life had she been kissed like that, and she suspected she would never be kissed like that again by anyone else. \n** \n\u201cIt\u2019s that gardener, he\u2019s the demon,\u201d Seth told Marcus as they entered his house. \nMarcus sat down on the leather chair in Seth\u2019s living room and poured himself some whiskey, it wasn\u2019t unusual for vampires to drink alcohol, it was no substitute for blood, but the warmth was comforting. \n\u201cI wonder what he wants with her, it\u2019s strange for a demon to become attached to a human how long has he been sniffing around her?\u201d Marcus asked swigging the drink then rolling the glass between his hands. \n\u201cAbout a week,\u201d he told him, lying down on the sofa and folding his arms behind his head. \n\u201cVery strange, I think the gardener has been possessed recently, because if that demon had full control of him then she would have been attacked by now, is she acting differently?\u201d \n\u201cNot that I\u2019ve noticed, but you know I can\u2019t sense demons,\u201d Seth said with a sigh. \nHe had the gift of being able to read people\u2019s thoughts, when he was first turned it was more of a curse all he heard was everyone\u2019s thoughts and feelings and it was just constant noise, but over the years he learnt to control it and now he could access thoughts at will rather than having them entering his head on their own. Marcus was different though he could sense their enemies, Seth could tell a werewolf by their scent and a witch was always easy to distinguish, but the demons were hard to sense because they could cover their scent with that of a human, which is where Marcus came in. \n\u201cThe demon won\u2019t possess her anyway, not if the one he has possessed is fresh he will be too weak to possess another.\u201d \nSeth was relieved to hear that, because if a demon did possess her then she would have to see a priest and he couldn\u2019t exactly get his hands on a priest not easily anyway. \n\u201cAll this talk of demons is making me want to kill one,\u201d Seth said looking out of the doors that led to his garden. \n\u201cWell we will have to entice this one over here somehow, then you can kill it,\u201d Marcus said pouring another whiskey. \n\u201cShall we go and hunt, I\u2019m rather hungry,\u201d Seth said sitting up and running his hand through his messy hair. \nMarcus smiled and put the whiskey down, the thought of blood was much more appealing than an alcoholic drink. He loved to hunt, but he had been asleep for well over one hundred years, because he had become bored of the world, and Seth had become difficult to put up with. Seth left a trail when he killed, he had always been a messy killer, it was as though he wanted the humans to know about vampires. \n\u201cPromise to be on your best behaviour then,\u201d Marcus warned before they left the house. \nSeth chuckled and nodded, Marcus knew it was a pointless suggestion and that Seth would deliberately put a show on now just for him. Seth dragged him back inside the house and up to his room before they left and started hunting for something for him to wear. \n\u201cWhat are these?\u201d Marcus asked looking at the jeans in his hands. \n\u201cThat my friend is denim,\u201d he said passing him the loose fitting jeans and a shirt. \n\u201cOh right, I\u2019ve missed quite a bit haven\u2019t I?\u201d he asked looking down at the shirt and jeans and then at the boots that Seth threw at him. \n\u201cYou\u2019ll be glad you missed the eighties, believe me they wore some horrendous looking clothes back then,\u201d he told him with a look of disgust. \nSeth pushed him towards the bathroom and Marcus looked at the shower in wonder, \u201cJust get in it and turn it on, you smell like the dead.\u201d \n\u201cI am dead,\u201d he said with a look of confusion. \n\u201cOk you smell like a rotting corpse.\u201d He told him honestly. \n\u201cOh thanks, well you smell like a brothel, what is that?\u201d he asked sniffing him. \n\u201cShut up, and go and wash yourself,\u201d he said shoving him into the bathroom and closing the door. \nSeth sat by the window looking over at Paige\u2019s house, he tried to listen into her thoughts but sensed nothing which meant she was asleep. He couldn\u2019t resist taking a peek, so he slid the window open and dropped down then opened her front door shaking his head she hadn\u2019t locked it the foolish woman. Her bedroom door on the other hand was locked which made him smile, she wasn\u2019t that stupid then, but he was a master at picking locks and with great ease he was in within seconds. \nShe looked so peaceful, but she looked lost in that big bed all on her own, Seth shook his head at where his thoughts were leading him again and decided to leave before he got into bed with her. Just as he was about to leave she started to mutter in her sleep, he was intrigued so he stepped closer to the bed. \n\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me,\u201d she whispered, rolling over, her brown curls splaying over the pillow. \nFor a moment Seth thought she was awake, but her deep breathing and steady heart told him that she was in fact asleep, but was she asking for him to stay, unless she was imagining that demon gardener he thought angrily. \nSomething in him snapped, and he climbed onto the bed and turned her neck to the side, sinking his fangs into her warm inviting skin. She woke up but he stifled her scream of shock with his hand and gently lapped at the blood that was dribbling down her neck and onto the silk pillows beneath her. \nHe slowly removed his hand from her mouth, and rested it on her chest that was heaving from her shallow breaths. She was in shock from his attack he could see it her deep brown eyes that had glazed over. \n\u201cSsh little one, it\u2019s okay,\u201d he whispered, consoling her. \nShe looked up at him with wide eyes, how had he managed to get into her room again she wondered peering over at the door, the door she remembered locking. He smirked at her as he read her thoughts, and before she could voice her question he kissed her again. She sighed into the kiss as his tongue slid into her mouth, and his hands slipped her nightdress up, bunching it up around her hips. \n\u201cWait,\u201d she gasped, he wanted to have sex with her? She was more confused than she had ever been now, if he wasn\u2019t terrifying her by attacking her, he was softening the blow with a passionate kiss and now he was trying to have sex with her, it was too much for her mind to handle. \n \nVote, comment Fan :) \n\n\n"

She sighed in relief at the welcome interruption of Marcus strolling into her bedroom. \nMarcus raised his eyebrows at the compromising position that they were in and smirked at Seth, \u201cWhat do we have here?\u201d \nSeth seemed to come to his senses and jumped off the bed and threw the sheets back over her, so that Marcus couldn\u2019t see anything and then he turned to face him furious for the unwanted interruption. \n\u201cLet's go,\u201d he said gripping Marcus\u2019s arm and dragging him from the room. \nPaige glared at the retreating vampires and grabbed her dressing gown pulling it on and chasing after them, she needed to know what he wanted from her, but by the time she got to the bottom of the stairs they were no where to be seen. \nMarcus was annoyed that he had walked in on them if he had just left it a while longer then Seth would have no doubt claimed her. Seth was silent as they made their way into the town centre to hunt, and Marcus thought it better not to question him. He stopped abruptly when the scent of the demon he had been tracking hit him, he was close by and it looked like his plan to feed was over as he started to follow the scent. \n\u201cWhere are you going the bars are this way,\u201d Seth said frowning at Marcus who was walking towards the old church that stood in the centre of town. Seth shuddered as he followed Marcus into the church, it was a beautiful church and Seth could remember when it had been built, but now it was looking old and tired the bricks crumbling, leaving it looking neglected. \nHe raised his eyebrows at the sight of a man on his knees, kneeling at the foot of the cross, pleading and muttering incoherently. \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d Seth asked, as they approached the figure. \nMarcus nodded his head to the man that had his back to him and Seth glared at him, so he read his thoughts again deciding it was easier than trying to get an answer out of him. He smirked after he had read his thoughts and walked around to the front of the steps and looked down at Zak. \n\u201cHe won\u2019t help you,\u201d Seth said motioning to the stained glass window depicting Jesus. \nZak\u2019s head shot up and he looked at Seth with fear and then anger as he fought against the demon that was taking over his body and mind. He had come to the church in hope that it would stop the demon, but it seemed to make him angrier. \n\u201cIf that demon leaves you now you will die anyway,\u201d Marcus informed him standing next to Seth. He knelt down and pressed his hand to Zak\u2019s head and muttering in Latin. \nZak slumped down against the steps and then rose up again, but this time it wasn\u2019t Zak that was talking it was the demon inside him, he was weak from being in the church which meant he couldn\u2019t attack. \n\u201cIpes what do you want with the girl?\u201d Marcus asked looking into the black eyes of the demon. \n\u201cHer soul is pure,\u201d he rasped with a smirk. \nThat angered Seth, he hated demons but this one was strong and he couldn\u2019t attack it when he was at an unfair advantage, because all hell would break loose, quite literally. \n\u201cYou and I both know that you can\u2019t possess another unless the body you have taken over dies.\u201d Marcus told him, he was standing in front of Seth making sure he wasn\u2019t going to attack in temper. \n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m going to claim her,\u201d He said standing up. \nMarcus held Seth back as he felt his anger rising, he was going to pounce on him and kill him for what he had said. \n\u201cYou will do nothing of the sort!\u201d he roared launching at him, but Marcus held him back with great difficulty as the younger vampire's anger seemed to build to heights that he had never seen before. \n \nIpes smirked at Seth\u2019s outburst, so she was his mate, he wasn\u2019t sure at first, but now he had just confirmed it and it was time for revenge. The demon that had attacked Paige, the one that Seth had killed was Ipes\u2019s sister and he wanted to make Seth feel the pain he had felt. \nSeth was fuming as Marcus held him back and allowed the demon to leave the church in one piece. The second the church door closed Seth slammed Marcus into the cross making it wobble and fall with a loud thud onto the dusty floor of the church. \n\u201cYou let it go!\u201d he shouted, \u201cWhy are you helping it?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m not helping it, we both know you can\u2019t attack it when it is defenceless you will bring more our way, do you really want to start a war!\u201d Marcus hissed pushing Seth away from him and smoothing his shirt back down. \nHe couldn\u2019t have cared less if it started a war, he wanted them to come, because he would enjoy killing each and every one of them. There was nothing he liked more than watching them die, sending them back to the depths of hell where they belonged. \n\u201cLet them come, see if I care!\u201d he snapped, pacing around the church. \n\u201cYou\u2019re a fool, you think it will be easy, you think that they will be weak? You\u2019re more of an idiot than I thought. Ipes is one of the most powerful demons from hell and you think that killing him will be brushed aside, you can\u2019t even begin  to understand the trouble you will cause!\u201d Marcus bellowed. \nThis was what aggravated him about Seth, he didn\u2019t think before he acted, he never had, there had been so many times over the years when he had killed witches for no reason, luckily for him Marcus had covered his scent and the witches never find out, because if they had known what he had done they would have been hunted down and cursed. \n\u201cYou have put my mate in danger now, how can I protect her during the day!\u201d he yelled kicking the font over, Marcus hissed as some of the holy water splashed on his skin burning him. \nSuddenly an idea hit Seth and he hunted around the church for some sort of container, he finally found a vial in a box underneath the stand where the priest stood and with great pain tipped some of the water into it. He grimaced as the water burnt his fingers and Marcus twisted his face as he watched him, his burnt skin already healing. \n\u201cWell you\u2019re not actually as stupid as you look,\u201d he mocked. \nSeth dropped the vial into his pocket and bit his lip in agony as his scorched fingers started to heal. \n\u201cIt won\u2019t stop him but it will weaken him right?\u201d Seth asked hopefully. \nMarcus nodded, if you couldn\u2019t bring the girl to the church, take the church to the girl he thought watching his friend as he blew on his burnt hand. \n\u201cYou really care for her don\u2019t you?\u201d \n\u201cNo!\u201d Seth spat. \nMarcus rolled his eyes, he was a terrible liar no vampire would burn themselves with holy water for no reason, many wouldn\u2019t even do it for a mate. It was an excruciating kind of pain, it was one of the only things  that was true about vampires, holy water was dangerous although it would take a large amount to kill one, but it was good enough to stun them. As for crucifixes, stakes and garlic that was just some nonsense dreamt up by some idiot in Hollywood. \n\n\n"

He was just lying there on her bed looking relaxed like he didn\u2019t have a care in the world, the more she thought about it the more she realised he probably didn\u2019t have a care in the world. \n\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d she finally asked breaking the silence. \nSeth looked up thrown by her question, he\u2019d been asking himself the same thing over and over again. What did he want from her because he had already set it in his mind that he wasn\u2019t going to claim her and apart from bringing her the holy water he had no other reason to be there. \n\u201cI don\u2019t want anything from you,\u201d he said looking straight at her. \nShe didn\u2019t believe him, she found it strange that a vampire wouldn\u2019t attack a human and after so many opportunities to kill her he still hadn\u2019t. \n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d she told him staring back at him. \nShe wasn\u2019t backing down, she wanted to know why he had spared her life time and time again, she needed to know why he had kissed her. \n\u201cYou want the truth?\u201d he asked flashing her his fangs, \u201cI want you to hate me, despise what I am, you should fear me but you don\u2019t.\u201d \n\u201cHow can I fear you when you keep kissing me like that,\u201d she whispered, her cheeks flushing at the thought of his soft lips on hers again. \nHe laughed and shook his head, \u201cIf you could see into my mind for one day then believe me you wouldn\u2019t want me to kiss you, if you could see what I have done.\u201d \nShe had already thought about that, she had seen it in that dream that he had killed and she knew he had killed many, but she still found him attractive. \nShe changed the subject quickly not liking the way he was looking at her,\u201cI meant to ask you, if you translated that page for me?\u201d \n\u201cI couldn\u2019t but Marcus can read Latin, so I woke him up.\u201d \nPaige frowned at him, \u201cWhat do you mean you woke him up?\u201d \n\u201cHe had been asleep since the early nineteenth century. Now that\u2019s a sight that would have given you nightmares.\u201d He told her harshly. \nThat was another thing that pissed him off, he\u2019d woken Marcus when he had managed to avoid it for so long and now he was going to be stuck with him for who knew how long all because of her. \n\u201cWho is he?\u201d she asked, she assumed he was a vampire but knew nothing else. \n\u201cHe made me what I am,\u201d he spat. \nFor the second time that morning it had him thinking about the past, something he hadn\u2019t done for a very long time. He had never talked about it before but now within the space of a few hours it was all being dragged back up. \n\u201cOh,\u201d was all she said, she watched him as he seemed to become annoyed with her and decided to leave it. \nHe read her thoughts again and was irritated to know that she found Marcus attractive, and that was something that didn\u2019t sit well with him. \n\u201cDon\u2019t be allured by his beauty, that vampire is evil through and through,\u201d he said his voice rising. \nIf there was one thing he knew for certain is was not to trust Marcus, he would never risk leaving them alone, part of him believed he wouldn\u2019t hurt her, but the other part of him was convinced he would. \n\u201cDoes the same go for you?\u201d she asked. \nHe moved so quickly she didn\u2019t see him and her hair was moved to the side and his mouth was on her neck, she was waiting for him to bite her, for the sharp sting of his fangs but it didn\u2019t come. \n\u201cI\u2019m much worse,\u201d he whispered, sending shivers down her spine. \nSeth couldn\u2019t keep his hands off her, being in the same room and not touching her was too much to ask, it was the reason he didn\u2019t want to be stuck in the same house as her, he knew he was going to lose his resolve. \n\u201cDo you want this?\u201d he whispered huskily, his warm breath fanning against her neck. \nAll she could do was nod, not even knowing what it was he was asking her. He turned her around to face him, his blue eyes piercing through her, she could see the desire there, the way his eyes lazily trailed from her face downwards then back again, before he flashed her a smile that shattered her heart. \nHis lips slammed against hers, and he kissed her so hungrily that she thought her heart was going to burst out of her chest, the fierceness behind that kiss was overwhelming and had her moaning into it. \nThe sound of her soft moans nearly pushed him over the edge he was so tempted to bite her that it made his fangs throb with the need to be in her neck. \n\u201cI\u2019m not doing this, I can\u2019t,\u201d he hissed pushing her away. \nShe was furious to be pushed away again, he was driving her wild, she knew that he wanted her, he was never going to kill her, and she wanted him just as much. She was so dazzled by him that the thought of what he was capable of didn\u2019t even cross her mind. \n\u201cFine, there is someone else just dying to have me!\u201d she screamed in frustration. \nShe regretted her words the second they left her mouth as his eyes widened in anger and his fist flew into her mirror shattering it. \n\u201cWho?\u201d he roared. \nPaige was trying to work out the distance between her and the door but as if he had just sensed what she was going to do he was in front of it. \n\u201cTell me who?\u201d he demanded angrily. \n\u201cWhy what business is it of yours!\u201d she shouted. \nSeth growled and bared his fangs at her again, he moved from the door and grabbed her pinning her against the wall. He could feel her heart pounding, as she pushed her little hands against his chest trying to push him away. \n\u201cEverything you do is my business, everything you think is my business, you belong to me and you will do well to remember that before you go jumping into bed with anyone!\u201d he warned. \n\u201cI don\u2019t belong to anyone!\u201d \nWhy did he say that she wondered looking at him in confusion, why did he think he had some sort of a claim over her life. So he had kissed her, attacked her, blew her mind into oblivion but that did not mean he owned her and she was damn sure she was going to prove that to him. \n \n \nVOTE COMMENT FAN :) \n \n\n\n"

He was thankful when dusk came because being so close to her was sending his mind into a place he didn\u2019t want it to go. \n\u201cDon\u2019t forget what I told you,\u201d he warned again before he swung the bedroom door open and vanished. \nHe nearly laughed at his own demand as he walked down her winding staircase, he pushed her away yet he was telling her she couldn\u2019t move on he knew very well how much he was contradicting himself. \nPaige was overcome with anger when he left she was sick and tired of him and his mood swings, she couldn\u2019t work out what he wanted. When she thought he was going to kiss her he attacked her, and when she thought he was going to attack her he kissed her. \n\u201cI hate you!\u201d she screamed, hoping he would hear her. \nShe didn\u2019t know why she was allowing it to happen, she had always been so strong when it came to men, but he was no ordinary man and it was the hardest situation she had ever been in, she hated him, but at the same time she wanted his touch, needed it. \nShe opened her closet and started to pull clothes out, trying to find the most revealing item she owned, she threw clothes everywhere until she found a skirt that was so short she wondered what the hell had possessed her to buy it. \nCurling her hair and plastering a ridiculous amount of makeup on, she pulled on the skirt and found a low cut top to wear. She walked into the bathroom and looked at herself in the mirror and shook her head, this wasn\u2019t her so why was she going to lower herself to wear something that made her look so cheap and easy. \nShe resisted the urge to take the skirt off and walked over to the window, she peeked through the window and she saw him and Marcus leaving his house, no doubt going to suck the blood from some poor souls, so she called a taxi to take her into a bar in town knowing that he wouldn\u2019t see her. \nWhen she got to the club it was heaving, it was still early though and she was shocked to see that many people in there, but she pushed her way through the crowd and after what felt like a lifetime of queuing she finally got to order a drink. \nIt didn\u2019t take long for some drunk to start chatting her up and she smiled sexily and fluttered her eyelashes, getting another drink out of him. \n\u201cWhat are you doing here on your own?\u201d the man slurred, sitting next to her and sipping on his beer. \nShe shrugged and smiled at him, \u201cJust came out for a drink.\u201d \nThe mans eyes raked over her body and the way he looked at her, repulsed her. It wasn\u2019t that he wasn\u2019t attractive, and any other time she might have gone for someone like him, but the thought of anyone other than Seth kissing her made her queasy. \nThen she reminded herself about how he had told her she belonged to him and it fuelled her anger again. What she did next was foolish even for her, and she knew it as she invited the drunk back to her house. He was more than willing and nearly fell over his own feet dragging her to the taxi bay outside. \nShe had hid a bottle of vodka in her handbag and slipped it out inside the taxi swigging it down, trying to build up some courage. When the taxi arrived at her house she was feeling a little tipsy and grabbed his hand dragging him up her drive and through her front door. \nShe pushed him against the wall and started to kiss him, but the taste of him and the feel of his wandering hands was disgusting and she pulled away. He looked at her with a smile and stumbled towards her. \n\u201cI don\u2019t even know your name,\u201d he mumbled, kicking his shoes off and unbuttoning his jeans. \n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked in disbelief as he hopped around pulling his jeans off. \nHe didn\u2019t seem to hear her though and when his jeans were off he was coming towards her and grabbing her slamming her into the table in her hall and knocking an ornament onto the floor smashing it. She tried to push him away but he mistook her hands on him as a signal to carry on and he trailed wet sloppy kisses down her neck. \n\u201cNo,\u201d she groaned, as his mouth covered hers and he held her head in place. \n\u201cNo?\u201d he repeated. \n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want this it was a mistake I shouldn\u2019t have brought you here.\u201d She told him, hoping that it would stop him. \n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be shy,\u201d he said kissing her again. \nShe pushed him away from her roughly and slapped him, \u201cI said no!\u201d \nHe slapped her back so hard that she fell to the floor, when she put her hand to her mouth there was blood and she panicked he looked pissed off. \n\u201cLook I\u2019m sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have led you on,\u201d she rambled. \n\u201cDon\u2019t worry I get the message!\u201d he hissed looking at her and shaking his head. \nShe breathed a sigh of relief, but when he walked back over to her and pulled her up by her hair and pushed her against the wall again she screamed. She kept looking at the door as the man held her to the wall kissing her again and hitching her skirt up. \nShe thought Seth would burst through the door, but he didn\u2019t and she was terrified. She closed her eyes silently praying it would be over quickly, he let go of her hand and she gripped onto the table at her side and that\u2019s when she noticed the iron doorstop. \nIt was a stupid place to put a doorstop she thought, but as she picked it up and slammed it into his head it was the best place she had ever left it. He let go of her and stumbled backwards, his eyes wide with shock, then he hit the floor with a thud, blood pouring from the gash in his head. \nThe sight of the blood made her stomach turn and she started to really panic, she ran into the kitchen and grabbed her phone and shakily dialled the emergency services but her hands were sweating and she dropped the phone. She ran back into the hall and checked the man's pulse, and she started to sob when she couldn\u2019t find one and backed away from him and sat against the wall crying. \n** \n \n\u201cYou\u2019re tense, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Marcus asked Seth as they walked up the gravelled driveway towards his house. \nSeth stopped and looked at him, \u201cDo you hear that?\u201d \nMarcus listened he couldn\u2019t hear anything, \u201cNo but I can smell blood.\u201d \nSeth\u2019s mind went into overdrive, he shouldn\u2019t have left the house, something had happened to her and it was all his fault. He raced to her house, expecting to see the demon there, but as he pushed the front door open the first thing he saw was the half naked man on the floor, then his eyes found a sobbing, rocking Paige. \n\u201cWhat the fuc...\u201d \n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t listen, I killed him!\u201d she sobbed. \n \n\n\n"

He pushed the bedroom door open and as soon as he saw the mess he started to wonder if more had happened between the man than he had thought, but he had read her mind and surely he would have seen if he had done something to her. He shrugged and shoved some clothes into a bag that he found in the closet, he wasn\u2019t going to let her stay on her own anymore, he wasn\u2019t taking the chance not with that demon on the loose, he still hadn\u2019t made an appearance and Seth knew it was only a matter of time. \nHe walked back down the stairs and saw Marcus sitting on the doorstep with a frown on his face, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Seth asked, he wasn\u2019t particularly concerned either way. \n\u201cNothing,\u201d he said looking up. \nMarcus couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Isabella, it hadn\u2019t been something that he wanted to think about, part of the reason he had been asleep for so long. Now he was awake it was only a matter of time before she came and her arrival was not something he looked forward to not how things had ended last time they had seen each other. He had rejected her, his mate it was she who turned him, she found her mate like Seth had with Paige and she turned him as soon as she saw him, but he didn\u2019t thank her for it, he hated her for it. She tried so desperately over the years to make things better for him, he was like a spoiled child, everything he wanted he got, she thought things were getting better between them, but he was just using her, unable to forgive her for turning him. He sat and thought about the night they had parted. \nShe was furious at how cold he was towards her, sick of it, and he knew there was only so long she was going to put up with it before she exploded. She stalked towards him her blue eyes glowing with the rage that she had been holding back for over eighty years, that was how long she had put up with his coldness towards her, tried to convince herself that he would come around, but she knew now that he never would. Her shoulder length blonde hair shimmered underneath the moonlight that was creeping in through the stained glass window of the church that she had dragged him in, she was beautiful there was no denying it, she was small but her size didn\u2019t take away the fact she was dangerous, strong and  ruthless. \n\u201cWhy do you hate me so?\u201d She asked looking at him, her rage replaced with sadness. \nLike he even needed to dignify that with an answer, he looked at her sternly, she was never going to get what she wanted from him he would hate her for turning him into the monster he was forever, he didn\u2019t want a vampire for a soulmate. \n\u201cWhere do I begin, how long have you got?\u201d he mocked. \nIsabella had been thinking over what she was going to do for a long time, it wasn\u2019t as though she had taken the decision lightly, but now as she looked over at Marcus she could see the hate for her in his eyes, he hated her for loving him and she couldn\u2019t deal with it anymore, that\u2019s why she let him go, but it wasn\u2019t forever and she was going to make sure he knew that. \n\u201cI\u2019ll give you one hundred years, I think that\u2019s plenty of time. You will be seeing things differently by then, will have seen the world so many times over, you will appreciate what love actually is!\u201d she hissed. \nWhat she didn\u2019t count on though was him going to sleep, whilst he slept she couldn\u2019t find him and the only person who knew where he was Seth, and because they had no connection she couldn\u2019t find him. \nIt was Marcus dreaded the most, she would have sensed him the second he woke and he was surprised she hadn\u2019t come by now, she was going to be more than angry when she came and he knew it, and if Seth knew of how he had rejected his mate and why he wouldn\u2019t turn Paige in fear of her acting the same way. \n\u201cAre you going to sit there until sunrise?\u201d Seth asked waving his hand in front of his spaced out maker. \n\u201cHmm, oh I\u2019m coming now,\u201d he muttered standing up and walking back towards Seth\u2019s house. \nSeth rolled his eyes and walked through his front door, he dropped her bag onto the stone floor in his kitchen and grabbed a glass from the cupboard, \u201cDo you think she will want a drink?\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t know, pour her a whiskey,\u201d Marcus said thrusting the bottle in his face. \n\u201cI was thinking more along the lines of water, put that away,\u201d he said shaking his head, he turned the tap on and let it run before filling the glass and walking out of the kitchen. \n\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d Marcus told him as Seth walked up the stairs, he stopped to look at him and frowned, \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to keep me company, stay with her.\u201d \nSeth raised his eyebrows, he was going to anyway, the mood Marcus was in was irritating him, he would be no good for a conversation. He opened the bedroom door, slowly so that it didn\u2019t scare her and she looked over at him. \n\u201cI brought you something to drink,\u201d he offered awkwardly. \nIt was too human for him, and he wasn\u2019t used to it he couldn\u2019t remember what water tasted like, if it even tasted of anything. She shuffled over on the bed and he sat next to her passing her the water, she was still shaking he watched her as she drank and then passed him the empty glass. \n\u201cYou\u2019re safe now calm down,\u201d he said softly not liking the way her heart was thudding. \n \n \nA few days ago she would have laughed at that, a vampire putting her at ease, but she knew he wasn\u2019t going to harm her, but he was asking too much for her to calm down she had killed a man and it was weighing heavily on her mind. \n\u201cYou need to let it go, he deserved it if I had come while he was still alive I would have killed him anyway,\u201d he said. \nIt wasn\u2019t much of a reassurance, it was easy for him to say he killed every night, that was his life but it wasn\u2019t hers she had a conscious. \n\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t brought him back with me he would have still been alive,\u201d she whispered. \n\u201cYes and he would have gone on to rape other women, he was not a good person and you shouldn\u2019t beat yourself up about it, you defended yourself it\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d \nHe couldn\u2019t get it out of his head either, he kept thinking about what he could have done to her, and when he had read her mind and seen that she had wanted him to come and save her he was furious with himself for not being there to protect her like he said he would. \n\u201cI should have been around, but there\u2019s something else you need to know,\u201d He said deciding he needed to tell her about Zak. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked. \n\u201cZak, he\u2019s been possessed by a demon and he\u2019s coming for you,\u201d he told her looking into her eyes. \nShe didn\u2019t believe him, thought he was jealous, he could hear the thoughts spinning around in her mind, she was confused and dropping something like that on her wasn\u2019t helping. \n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid!\u201d she laughed. \n\u201cWell you\u2019re not going to find out anyway because you\u2019re not going near him again.\u201d \nShe ripped the sheets from around her and went to climb out of the bed, but he put his hand on her chest and pushed her back down, he wasn\u2019t letting her go again. \n\u201cYou\u2019re lying!\u201d she hissed, she couldn\u2019t believe he would make something like that up about her gardener out of spite. \n\u201cI\u2019m not lying and I\u2019ll prove it to you tomorrow night, I\u2019ll take you Marcus can track him and you can see for yourself just what your precious gardener has become!\u201d \nShe huffed and folded her arms over her chest, if he wanted to waste his time showing her something that she knew wasn\u2019t true he could carry on, because she was sick of being treated like some fragile thing that was going to break if she was touched. Yes she had put herself in danger tonight but she dealt with it, she didn\u2019t intend on killing the man but she it was him or her. \n\u201cFine do as you please,\u201d she said with a sigh, deciding it was so much easier to give into him. \nSeth smiled triumphantly she was too easy, he thought she would have put up a bigger fight than that, but the sooner he proved how much of danger Zak was the easier it would be to protect her. \n\u201cYou should go to sleep, I know you humans need your sleep,\u201d he said turning the beside light off. \n\u201cDon\u2019t you need to sleep?\u201d she asked staring at him, even though the lights were off she could still see his beautiful eyes piercing through the darkness. \n\u201cAre you asking me to sleep in the bed with you?\u201d \nPaige blushed a deep shade of red, it wasn\u2019t what she meant, but he got into the bed with a chuckle anyway and she shuffled to the edge so that he wasn\u2019t anywhere near her, all that was running through her mind was what if he got hungry during the day and decided she wasn\u2019t worth all the fuss and bit her. \n\u201cYou can come closer, I don\u2019t bite, well only sometimes,\u201d he said sarcastically. \nShe rolled her eyes at him, what an ironic thing for a vampire to say she thought rolling onto her side so that her back was to him, she wrapped her hair around her neck and huffed when he erupted into laughter. \n\u201cYou think your hair will stop me from biting you, that\u2019s so funny,\u201d he chuckled. \n\u201cShut up!\u201d she hissed, she grabbed a pillow and shoved it between them and he looked at her curiously. \n\u201cWhat is that for?\u201d he asked still laughing. \nPaige rolled over to face him and couldn\u2019t help but smile, his smile was infectious and clearly he was finding her rather amusing. \n \n\u201cThat is a boundary, you are not to come any further than that pillow!\u201d she demanded. \nSeth shook his head in amusement, the girl was insane if she thought wrapping her hair around her neck and putting a pillow between them was going to stop him. \n\u201cRight, and you think that a pillow is going to stop me, tell what is it you will do exactly if I move this?\u201d he said picking the pillow up and throwing it over the edge of the bed. \nPaige glared at him and sighed loudly, \u201cI\u2019m going home if you don\u2019t stop behaving like a child!\u201d \nSeth laughed again, that was rich coming from her he was three hundred years older than her, and she had the nerve to call him a child. \n\u201cAlright love, just go to sleep,\u201d he said with a final laugh. \n** \n \nMarcus had only been asleep for five minutes when he woke with a start, he could feel something, something big was coming and it was furious. He bit his lip it had been a long time since he had felt that connection, the pull to her, she was coming and she was more furious than he could have ever imagined. \nVote comment Fan \n \nMerry Christmas everyone, if you comment and my replies don't make sense blame it on the five southern comforts I have drunk lol :D \n\n\n"

There was something comforting about the way he was holding her protectively, but as his eyes opened and he became aware of the position they were in, Paige realised he wasn\u2019t happy. \n\u201cYou sleep walk!\u201d Seth snapped loosening his grip on her and rolling onto his back, \u201cI\u2019ve had to hold you there all night.\u201d \nHe was fuming she had no idea how hard it had been for him, to be pressed that tightly into her body, so close to her neck and not able to drink from her. It had been the worst kind of torture imaginable, he was amused at first when she had stumbled from the bed and walked out of the room, but it wasn\u2019t until she attempted to leave the house that he realised she was a danger to herself. \n\u201cSleepwalking?\u201d she asked with a laugh, he had to be joking. \nHe must have been making it up, what a stupid excuse she thought looking at his annoyed face, \u201cYes now if you don\u2019t mind I\u2019ve got somewhere to be, don\u2019t move.\u201d He told her. \nPaige raised her eyebrows and looked at him as though he was lying, \u201cWhere have you got to be?\u201d she asked, feeling that it was just an excuse to get away from her. \n\u201cMarcus is hiding something from me, I\u2019ve heard some of his thoughts,\u201d he told her looking to the door with a sigh. \nWhatever it was he was hiding it was scaring him, and fear was something Marcus had never shown. Seth stood to leave, but Paige grabbed his arm, he looked down at the hand that was resting on his arm and frowned. \nHe sat back down on the bed and as their eyes clashed it seemed to ignite something in Paige and before she could stop herself she was capturing his lips in a kiss, Seth gave into the kiss savouring the way her soft lips rubbed against his so sweetly. \n\u201cI need to speak to Marcus,\u201d he said getting up and rushing out of the room without a word. \nHow was he supposed to resist her, everything about her was screaming at him to turn her, to take her, to make her his like she was meant to be. He had never felt so conflicted about anything in his whole life, not this life or his human one. In some ways he wished he had been able to kill her, because he was scared that he was putting her in more danger just being around her, trouble always followed him, he attracted demons and witches and they would take her if they knew what she was. \nMarcus was lying on the sofa in the living room when Seth walked in, he had drunk four bottles of whiskey, and Seth shook his head at him. It was not as if a vampire could get drunk, so why waste time drinking, he would have much rather have had a human child, their blood was so sweet it intoxicated a vampire much like alcohol did to a human. \n\u201cYou need to tell me what\u2019s going on,\u201d Seth said slumping into the chair; he ran his arm over the soft leather trying to stop himself from wrapping his hands around Marcus\u2019s throat. \n\u201cShe\u2019s coming,\u201d Marcus said not looking up. \nSeth growled at his answer, it didn\u2019t exactly give anything away, who was she he wondered angrily, it was what he hated about Marcus amongst other things, his lack of straight answers. \n\u201cOh is she well that\u2019s nice, now if you would care to tell me who she is then it would be appreciated,\u201d he told him sarcastically. \n\u201cIsabella,\u201d Marcus spat, it hurt him to speak her name, made it more real. \nSeth raised his eyebrows, it wasn\u2019t often Marcus spoke of her, but from what he did know she was an old vampire, the one who made him. He had never said much about her, where she was from or what she was like. \n\u201cHow would you know that?\u201d he asked, then it dawned on him that the only way he would sense if she was coming was if she was mated to him and that couldn\u2019t be possible, Marcus had no mate he had told him so. \n\u201cShe is my mate, the one I am meant to love, and protect, the one I belong with, the one I was cursed to be with!\u201d he scoffed. \nMarcus despised her more than anything, even after two hundred years he didn\u2019t wish to see her again, he had no desire for a mate as evil as her, and not one that was as powerful as she was, she made him feel so inadequate. \n \n\u201cWhat!\u201d he roared, even though he had figured it outfor himself it still shocked him to hear him say it. \nMarcus stood up and walked over to the piano that was in the corner of the room, he sat down and ran his long fingers across the keys, \u201cShe is the first of our kind the most powerful, the whole reason for our existence.\u201d \nSeth didn\u2019t know what angered him more, the fact Marcus had lied to him and told him that he had no mate, or that he was bringing something so powerful their way there would be no way he could protect Paige. \n\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, wanting to know why they were not together. \n\u201cI rejected her; I hate her more than anything. She is sick, twisted, and pure evil.\u201d He told Seth as he started to play the piano. \nSeth nearly laughed, they were all evil it didn\u2019t matter how anyone tried to paint them, they killed, fed, tortured and they loved it. How he could sit there and say she was anymore evil than them puzzled him. \n\u201cWe must kill her,\u201d Marcus told him, he wanted to get rid of her and she hadn\u2019t even arrived. \nHe was ready to take her on, he was stronger than before, and he knew her weakness, the weakness for him. He needed to gain her trust again, it was something that he knew would not be easy, but he was going to attempt it, and he needed Seth\u2019s help. \n\u201cYou want to kill the first vampire, and how do you propose we do that exactly,\u201d Seth questioned. \nThey both shut up as the door to the living room opened and Paige walked in rubbing her head and yawning, \u201cGo back to bed, I will be up in a minute,\u201d Seth ordered. \n \n\u201cI was actually going home,\u201d she informed him stretching and then turning her back on him, she didn\u2019t even get to make another step as she was thrown over his shoulder and he stormed upstairs throwing her onto his bed. \n\u201cI said I will be up in a minute, do not leave this room!\u201d he growled. \nShe narrowed her eyes at him, but shrunk back as he bared his fangs angrily, he was in no mood for a childish tantrum, he had bigger more important things to deal with than his little mate telling him she was doing this and that. \n\u201cYou can\u2019t keep me here like some prisoner!\u201d she screamed. \n \nHow dare he think he could lock her in a room and tell her what to do, he had no right. She got off the bed determined to show him, but he stalked towards her, his blue eyes glowing with anger. It wasn\u2019t even her that he was angry with, but he could have done without her making things difficult for him. \n\u201cAnd tell me what is it you think you are going to do to stop me exactly?\u201d he mocked. \nShe was no match for him, she was a mere human but he loved how she challenged him, it was entertaining if nothing more, but he really didn\u2019t have time to play games with her, there were more pressing matters to deal with. \n \nWhen she pulled the little vial of holy water out of her bra, Seth erupted into laughter even as she unscrewed the lid and threw it at him, he resisted the urge to rip her throat out as it burnt his face, and he bit down on his lip to stop the groan of pain. \n\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t have done that!\u201d he growled as he trapped her between his body and the wall. \n \nPaige watched in horror as his beautiful face burnt then smoothed out before her eyes, he looked every bit as vicious as he was when he reared his head back and sank his fangs into her shoulder. She screamed as pain rushed through her body and he caught her in his arms as her legs gave way. \nSeth had bit straight into a nerve knowing it would cause her enough agony to keep her trapped in that room for at least a few days. He wasn\u2019t bothered that he had hurt her, he was capable of much worse and she would do well to remember that next time she decided to throw holy water in his face. \n\u201cPlease just kill me?\u201d she sobbed, she didn\u2019t know what he wanted anymore, but she couldn\u2019t take anymore of his contradictions. \n \nSeth felt a pang of guilt at her tears, he forgot how fragile she was although it had been his intention to hurt her, he had not considered it wasn\u2019t just physical pain anymore, she felt the pull to him but didn\u2019t understand it. \n\u201cI\u2019m not going to kill you!\u201d he hissed, he walked out of the room, leaving her on the bed. \nSeth tried to block out the wracked sobs that were coming from her, but it was killing him and when he walked back into the living room and Marcus glared at him, his anger built again. \n\u201cDon\u2019t you even dare tell me how to treat her, not after what you have done!\u201d he shouted. \n \nMarcus had developed a soft spot for the human girl upstairs though; he knew their bond would be different from his and Isabella\u2019s it was just how to convince him that was the problem. As Seth faced up to Marcus the front door burst open and Seth\u2019s eyes widened at the power that emanated from the small woman that appeared in his doorway covered in human blood. \n \n \nVote, comment Fan :) \n\nThis comment may be offensive. \n\n"

So y'all shouldn't come to the comments and say the events are exactly like something you read from another book, please. Thank you. \nYou may proceed... \nYesterday was one of the worst days in my life. It was my dad and step mom's anniversary. \nI had to do almost everything because my step sister, though she's sweet and nice, she doesn't like to do too much work. You can call her lazy but she's one of those girls that dream about becoming a fashionista. \nAfter washing the dishes, I went to my room. I was so tired that I didn't bother to change into my PJs. * I woke up with my head aching severely. I had my bath and put on a black tank top and jean pants with a black jacket to match. I was about to open my room door when I heard hushed tones from downstairs, I recognized one of the voices as my step mom's. Half of me wanted to eavesdrop and the other half just wanted to curl up in bed for some time. Before I decided on what to do, my step mom called me \n\"Britt!\" \nI put on my slippers and went downstairs. \nI saw my step mom with three men, they were all wearing suits. I saw an evil grin playing on my step mom's face which she quickly replaced with a fake smile when she realized that I was looking at her. \n\"Sit\". She said, patting the space beside her. I sat and studied the men. \nLike seriously?!? How could men look this hot and still lack essential nutrients?!? \nI'm saying this because the men looked so pale and yet so hot. \nEnough drooling, I have to focus on why they're here. \nIs one of them Claire's boyfriend? \n(My step sister's name is Claire) \n\" You're gonna be living with your aunt,\". My step mom announced. \"These men came to pick you up so get your things ready and meet us here in twenty minutes\". \nWait, what?!? \nI don't remember having any aunt that'd want me to live with them. \n(They don't really like me) \nYou must be kidding! \nI wanted to shout at the top of my lungs and tell them to fuck off cause I wasn't going anywhere but I still wanted answers to some questions. \n\"Does dad know about this?\" I asked. \n\"He totally supports it\". She replied. \nOh, really?!? \nIf that's true then he's definitely not the dad I knew in the past years. Dad doesn't let me stay with my friends for more than three days not to talk of living with my aunt. Someone I don't know or hardly know. \n\"Stop staring, go and get ready\" she said. \nTill then, I didn't know that I was staring. \n\"She doesn't need to get ready. All the things she needs are there\". One of the men said. \nEverything about him screamed authority. \nNo, not yet. \n\"Wait, I need two minutes. Just two minutes please\". I pleaded. \nThe man nodded. \nI ran up the flight of stairs and closed my door behind me before letting the tears fall down my cheeks. \nI picked up my phone and dialed my dad's number. \n\"Dad?\" I said with weak voice \n\"Britt? I'm listening\". \n\"Do I really have to go to my aunt's home?\". \nHe sighed \n\"I'm afraid, it's true\". \n\"Really? I know you really want to get me out of your life so you can enjoy your 'marriage' with Evelyn (my step mother)but you could have easily murdered me\". I said, sobbing. \n\"I'm sorry\". \n\"Don't tell me sorry\". I snapped. \"Well, it's a good thing to finally get rid of me. Thanks a lot. Bye\". \nI hung up before he could say anything. \nI sat on the floor, hugging my knees tightly. I pressed my mouth against my knees so my sobs wouldn't be heard. I brought out a picture of my mom and kissed it. \nI never really got to know my mom cause she died when I was a little girl... About seven months old or something. \nThat was the only picture I had cause dad put away all the pictures of her since her death left him traumatized. \nI wiped my tears and kissed the picture one more time before keeping it in my jacket. \nI went downstairs and saw that my step mom was having a deep conversation with the man. After some minutes, she finally looked up and saw me. \n\"She's ready\". She announced to the men. \nThey stood up and the man that spoke earlier walked up to me. \nHe was so tall... \n\"Ehm... I'll take this\" he said and took my phone from me. \nWhat the heck?!??!? \n\"Wait a minute,\". I said, my anger elevating. I'm going to live with a fucking aunt and I'm not allowed to take my phone or even my clothes?! I yelled. \nThey all turned to look at me like I was a psycho. I had truly lost it at that point. \nHe put my phone in his pocket. \nThis dude really had a death wish. What the heck did he think he was doing? \n\" We have to get going now\" he said, handing over a huge bundle of cash to her \n\"Are you selling me off?\" I asked suspiciously. \n\"Fool, do you think anyone would want to take care of you for free?\". My step mom asked. \nOh, really? \nI'm really not going anywhere without a good fight. \n\"I'm not going\" I blurted out \n\"And why not?\" My step mom snapped. \n\"Because I can't leave my home for an unknown person's home\" \nI didn't know the aunt I was going to live with because I heard my step mom had three sisters but I'd only seen one and dad had only one sister and she was dead. \n\"We'll do it the hard way then. I've got no time to waste\". The same man said. \nI was ready to lash out my anger on him but a strong arm grabbed me by the arm and pulled me outside. \nHe pushed me into a black car and then it zoomed off at an incredibly fast speed. \nI was so ready to give him a very good lashing. \n\"You idiot. How dare you treat a lady like that?! Listen, I'm not a trash bag that you can just throw around the way you like. I'm a human and you should treat me like one! Next time you treat me l-\" \n\"You sure do talk a lot\". He said, bringing out a syringe. \n\"You want to inject me with that thing?\" I asked. \nI was actually getting scared. \nHe shrugged and then inserted it into my skin \nI felt completely normal until like two minutes later. \nI yelped when I felt a sharp pain in my head. \nI tried to talk but I was too weak to talk. \nBlack dots started filling my vision and then everything went blank. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nI hope you enjoyed the first chapter. \nThis is my first book on wattpad so please pardon my mistakes. \nI'll do my best to make this story really good considering the fact that I'm just thirteen (fourteen now) \nBut age is no excuse! I hope this story progresses. \nAlso, I'm not planning on having an update schedule so I'll update only when I have the time to. \nPlease vote and comment. \nLove y'all \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\ude18 \nP.S: All chapters are in Brittany's POV except stated otherwise :) \n\n\n"

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \n\"You injected too much in her...\" I heard a feminine voice saying. \n\"She talked too much\" a masculine voice grumbled. \nI couldn't react, whatever they injected into me had full effect on me. My head was pounding like crazy and I felt so weak. I tried opening my eyes but they were too heavy, I tried one more time and my eyes managed to open half way. I saw a blurry vision of a woman talking to a man whose height I could recognize to be that of the man that pushed me into the car earlier. They turned to look at me. \n\"She's getting conscious\" the lady said. \nI quickly shut my eyes back as a form of pretence. \nI felt a strong arm grip me. \nI've never been good at acting. \n\"Get up!\" His rough voice yelled, raising me up roughly. \n\"Be careful with her. A rare type isn't easy to come by these days\". She said. \nThe man scoffed. I tried to stand up but my limbs were too weak. \n\"She's still weak\" the lady said.  \"We can't take her for auction anymore. You caused all these, now we can only present her picture and some other information. You know weak pets are not allowed at the auction hall. You should have been more careful \". She scolded. \nSomeone carried me roughly, obviously the rough male. \nWhat if he wanted to kill me?! No-no-no I wouldn't let that happen. \nI started hitting his back with all my strength, that is, the little strength I had in me and you know what? He didn't even budge. I gave up when I became tired but I kept my eyes alert though it hurt but my life was precious so- \nHe threw me on a sofa and left. I looked at the lady, she was a pretty blonde with hair packed in a tight bun. Her skin was pale though. \nA lady with black hair came in with a suitcase, she put it beside the chair and left. The lady looked at me with a warm smile. \n\"You can have your bath if you want to\". She said. \nI'd have loved to, if only my legs wouldn't give up on me. Well, one try wouldn't hurt. \nI tried to stand up but no way! My legs were too weak, I just sank down back into the sofa. She smiled again. \n\"What's your name ?\" \n\"Brittany. Brittany Riele\" \n\"Age\" \n\"Fifteen\". \nShe had this look on her face but she dismissed it and scribbled the information on a book and continued. \n\"Allergies\" \n\"Pineapples, lemon and cats\" \n\"Any physical or emotional scars?\" \n\"Why do you want to know?\" I questioned. \n\"Answer the question\". She commanded. \nI found myself yielding to her command. \n\"Yeah. My mom's death and my dad's betrayal really affected me\". I said hesitantly. \nShe scribbled on the book again. \n\"Change your clothes, you can leave the jeans on\". She ordered. \"Put this shirt on\". \nShe tossed over a shirt to me. \nFoolishly, I expected her to leave. \n\"Go on, take it off\" she said with a smile plastered on her face. \nEmbarrassed, I took off my jacket and took out my mom's picture. To keep it safe, I tucked it in my jean pocket. \n\"What's that? She asked. \n\"A picture of my mom\". \n\"Let me see it\". \nI handed it over to her. She looked at it and gave it back to me. I kept it back in my jean pocket. The fact that I was yielding to everything this stranger told me to do made me angry but somehow, I couldn't express my anger. \n\"You look just like her, she's just an older version of you\". She said. \nI nodded. \nI took off my tank top. Her eyes raked through my body and she subconsciously smiled. My cheeks heated up. \n'This lady looks like she's going to rape us'. My stupid subconscious said. \nI ignored it. \nI quickly put on the pink shirt that revealed too much skin. It was backless and showed off a large amount of cleavage. My hands quickly went up to cover it. She smiled. \n\"Why are you covering yourself? You look good\". She said. \nI was confident in myself but I didn't like the way she looked at me so I still used my hands to protect myself. \n\" Don't. Cover. Yourself. Again \". She said, spacing each words with authority before plastering a sweet smile on her face. \n\"Now I'm gonna do your hair\". She said. \nShe stood up, applied some things to my hair and started styling it. Then she did my makeup. She didn't let me to look in the mirror so I had no idea what I looked like. \n\"Perfect!\" She said and dragged the full size mirror in front of me. I could hardly recognize myself. \nDid I look more beautiful or what? Okay, I'll admit, I did. The pink shirt showed my curves in the right places and my jeans looked tighter than I thought. I should have looked in the mirror before going downstairs to behold the news of living with my so-called aunt. \nSpeaking of which- \n\"Is this my so called aunt's home? I don't think I need to be dressed up like a barbie doll because I'm gonna be meeting my mysterious aunt\". I said. \"My step mom sent me here to live with her- Wait a minute, are you-\" \nShe chuckled. \n\"No darling\". She said as she cupped my face in her hands. I flinched at her touch, her hands were cold. \n\"This isn't your aunt's home dear, you were sold to us\". \nRealization dawned on me. My step mom sold me, that bundle of money! How could I be so stupid not to realizee that?!? Did dad know about selling me? \n\"Do you have a cellphone?\" I found myself asking the lady. \nShe nodded. \n\"Can you give it to me for a minute, please\". \nShe hesitated for a while. \n\"Sure\". She finally replied. \"But you have to let me listen in on your conversation and spare the details of your location or I'll be dead meat\". \nI nodded. She handed it over. I punched in my dad's number and dialed. \n\"Britt! I've been waiting for your call for days! Are you there already?\" He asked. \n\"Yeah\". \n\"I'm really sorry for....\" \n\"No time for apologies. I just wanted some answers and please, try to be honest\". \n\n\n"

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nAn arm continuously tapping me coupled with an headache woke me up. \n\"I'll be up in thirty minutes\" I mumbled. \n\"I'm not your mom, okay?....\" A voice that I could quite recognize said. \"now get ready and meet me or anyone else downstairs\" she said and left. \nI rubbed my eyes and groaned. I sat up and looked outside. I groaned again when I couldn't see anything clearly because of the rays of the sun. \nI looked around and got up only to discover that I wasn't in my cozy room. \nWas I teleported to wonderland? \nI was shocked for a minute, not until the memories came flooding back. I sighed and stood up, I walked towards two doors and opened the first door, it led to a luxurious bathroom. \nIs this bathroom mine or someone else's? \nI chuckled like a fool and undressed without even thinking of the consequences of having my bath in an unfamiliar bathroom. Someone could walk in for crying out loud! \nI turned on the shower, enjoying the cold bliss on my skin. I applied shampoo on my hair and left out the conditioner. After my bath, I tied a towel securely around my chest and went back to the room. I opened the other door and was met with an empty closet. I sighed. \nWhat was I supposed to wear now? \nDon't tell me I have to wear that stupid pink shirt again. \nI was still pondering on what to wear when someone knocked on my door. \n\"Come in\" I said and the door opened \nA lady of average height wearing a knee length white and black dress came in. \n\"I'm sorry for the delay ma'am\". She said \nShe dropped a pile of neatly folded clothes on my bed and left. \nI put on the rather revealing red dress and went out into the hallway. \nAll the doors looked similar and I was so confused. I just continued walking till I bumped into someone. \n\"Sorry\" we both apologized and went our different ways. \nI continued walking till I got to the dead end. \n\"You lost?\" \nA startling voice said from behind. It was the girl that I bumped into earlier. \nShe was an averagely pretty girl with dark hair, ocean blue eyes and well tanned skin. She looked like she was in her teenage years. \nI nodded. \n\"Come with me\". She said, holding my hand like I was her long lost friend. \nWe walked for sometime and went down a flight of stairs. \nShe took me to a place I suppose was the kitchen. Three heads turned to look at me. \n\"Stop staring guys, this is Brittany, Prince Cole's new pet\" she said. \nWait, how'd she know my name? \n\"Hi guys\" I said. \n\"Brittany, this is Sonia....\" She said, pointing at the mean girl from earlier. \nThe real me would have said something rude as a pay back for her mean attitude but I decided to play nice. \n\"We've met right?\" I said with a sweet smile. \n\"Yeah\" she said. She was surprisingly nicer this time. \n\"Kyle,\" she said, pointing at a guy with hazel eyes. \n\"Hi\" I said. \n\"Hi, nice to....\" \nHe started talking but the girl cut him off. \n\"And that's Andrew\" she said pointing at a guy that was busy doing what I didn't know. \nI couldn't see his face because he had his back turned to me but I could see his messy brown hair. \n\"What's your name?\" I asked remembering that she hadn't told me her name. \n\"Oh, sorry, I was busy introducing you to others- I haven't even introduced myself\". She said. \n\"I'm Chloe\" \n\"Nice to meet you Chloe\" I said and smiled. \nShe made herself busy by arranging plates with food in them into two trays. \nAfter arranging the plates, she put glasses of abnormally thick red wine into the trays. \nShe looked up to check the time on the wall clock. \n\"One more minute everyone\" she said. \nThey all covered the food and stood in a straight line. I stood behind Chloe and firmly held the tray that she handed over to me. \n\"Follow me\". she said. \nWe climbed up the flight of stairs and walked down the hallway. We stopped and she turned to look at me. \n\"I'll see you later\" she said. \"The information on the tray will tell you where you are going to and who you're going to meet\" \nWith that, she opened a door and walked inside closing the door behind her. \nI sighed. I searched for any information on the tray and saw. \n'Room 020. Prince Cole' written on it. \nI assumed I was to give the tray to Prince Cole who stayed at the twentieth room. Chloe had gone into the room that had an inscription that said '09' on it. \nI still had to walk further down the hallway. \n~~~~~~~~~~ \nI took in a deep breath and knocked the door gently. I knocked the door again but there was no reply. \nJust as I turned to leave, someone opened the door. I looked up to see the person. \nMy jaw dropped. A freaking Greek god was standing half naked before me with his towel hanging loosely on his waist. He looked hotter than Adonis himself. He was a tall blue eyed guy with pale skin that looked kinda tanned and well defined muscles. \n\"What do you want?\" He said, rolling his blue eyes. \nHe probably caught me staring at him so I closed my mouth and cleared my throat. \n\"Do you know anyone called Prince Cole?\" I asked. \n\"What do you want?\" He asked. \nStop repeating the same question! \n\"Uh, I came to give him this tray\". \n\"Who are you?\" \nHe was starting to annoy me. He was asking too much questions. \n\"Stop asking me questions. I came here to give this tray to Prince Cole, not to answer stupid questions.....\" \n\"Who do you think I am then?\" He asked as if I wasn't even making sense. \n\"We've never met before so how do expect me to know who you are?\" \n\"Huh, you're such a dummy. You came here asking for Prince Cole and this is obviously his room so who does that make me?\" \nShit! He was Prince Cole! \nI mentally scolded myself for being so stupid. \nI gathered enough boldness to continue talking. \n\"Y-you should have told me you were Prince Cole instead of asking questions\" \n\"You know you're wrong so stop defending yourself\". \n\"You should have told me\" I still defended. \n\"Just apologize and stop defending yourself\". He said in a bored tone. \nI didn't respond. \n\"Well, now that you know that I'm Prince Cole, who are you?\" \n\"Brittany\" \n\"Just Brittany?\" He asked. \nHe was obviously doing it on purpose.I glared at him before speaking again. \n\"I'm Brittany Riele\" \n\"You're new here, right?\" He asked. \nI nodded and he smirked. \n\"That's my breakfast I guess\" he said looking at the tray. \nI nodded. \n\"What's in it?\" He asked. \n\"I dunno\" I replied. \n\"Who served the food then?\" He asked. \n\"Someone\" I replied. \n\"Come in\" he said and opened the door so that I was able to fit in. \nI walked in then he closed the door behind us. \n*** A/N: Hey Beautiful People! \nI'm so sorry for the late update.

Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nI shifted uncomfortably in my seat. \n\"What's up with you?\" Chloe asked interrupting my thoughts. \nI didn't know if I should keep everything that happened to myself. \nWe were on break, actually, I wouldn't call it a break, we just didn't have anything doing so we just sat down lazily and discussed stuff, I wasn't really talking now because I was still trying to put pieces together. \nMy thoughts were interrupted again when she put her hand on my lap. \n\"You've been acting kinda weird since you came back from your Master's room, what happened?\" \nWithin a minute, I found myself pouring out everything to Chloe and I wasn't sure of how I felt when she didn't look surprised, not even close, her face was neutral. \nThis is exactly what happened..... \n*** After I closed the door behind us, I continued being rude. To me, he was just another guy that liked intimidating people like me. \nLiterally everything about me seemed more mature than my age. Well, that was what I thought but now I was beginning to believe it because everyone treated me like I was more than fifteen which seemed literally true. I had a feeling that dad was hiding something from me but I usually let it slide. Now, it was becoming more of an issue to me. I hated the look on people's faces when I told them my age, even Chloe seemed surprised, the only person that didn't seem really surprised was the lady from earlier... I even forgot to ask for her name, I guess this situation was turning me into something else. \nBack to my experience with Cole. I kept up with my rudeness. I was really enjoying the conversation until I said something that I can't quite figure out, I said too many things and I wasn't even looking up at him, if I was, I would have figured out what I said hours ago. The only thing I know is that his eye color had completely changed to a red color and that red was slowly turning black... At least I could grasp that much. \nHe ordered me to leave but I was being stubborn, not until the black started dominating. He told me to leave once more, his voice huskier than normal. I just ran away, surprisingly scared for my dear life. I heard a thud coming from his room but decided to ignore it and ran straight down till I found Chloe. I calmed down a bit after sitting. \n~~~~~~~~ \n\"Is that all?\" She asked \nI nodded. \n\"What is he?\" I asked in a whisper. \nShe smiled. \n\"No one ever told you\" She said. \nI didn't know if that was a statement or a question so I just stared at her. \nShe sighed. \n\"His eyes nearly turned black\" She said, more like talking to herself. \"And you can't figure out what you said to make him that angry?\" \nI ignored her question and asked again, hoping for a decent reply. \n\"What is he?\" I asked, louder than before. \n\"He...\" She stopped,and thought for a while and murmured \"you'll know sooner or later anyways\" \nI tilted my head sideways a little bit, impatiently waiting for a reply. \nShe exhaled a deep breath. \n\"He's a... V..vampire\" \nNO WAY!!! \nThis is the second time I'm hearing this, it can't be a joke. \n\"Are you serious?\" I asked, confirming what I just heard. \nShe nodded. \n\"How in the world do vampires exist?\" I asked in shock. \nChloe shrugged. \n\"It's just like questioning the existence of human. They've been existing for as long as many years back. Even before your ancestors were born\". \n\"Really?\" I asked, unsure of what to say. \nShe nodded. \n\"I wonder, how many more vampires exist?\" \n\"Almost more than the population of humans\". \n\"Wow! Are you one too?\" \n\"Uh... No\" \n\"Do vampires really have any supernatural abilities?\" \n\"Depends\" \n\"Do...\" \n\"Uh, save other questions for later, Master Cole's eyes turning black doesn't mean something good\". \n\"Why?\" \n\"Because he's....\" She hesitated. \"He's a pureblood\" \nWhat does that even mean? \n\"Wha...\" \n\"I'll explain later. I need to tell someone before things get out of hand\". She cut me short and practically rushed up the flight of stairs. \nI kept pondering on what she told me, I found this vampire thing amusing. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nThis chapter was really short, right? \nI'm sorry, I just prefer it like this. \nAlso, the reason for the late update is that I'm writing an exam but I'll do my best to update frequently after the exam. \nI hope you understand.

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nChloe started avoiding me since she told me about Cole being a vampire. \nSomething was definitely wrong. \nYesterday, I wanted to serve Cole's food when all the masters finally came to eat breakfast for the first time since I got there, Chloe just said that it was better if I didn't stay near Cole because I would probably get scared which was obviously a lie. \nWhy would I get scared by standing beside Cole? \nShe also avoided any form of eye contact with me. \nI also noticed a scar on her swollen cheek. \nI decided to ask her. \nI stood up from my bed and left my room. \nI walked downstairs with the hope of finding Chloe. \nI walked around the house and I swear, I never knew the house was this big till today. I walked around for what seemed like an hour and I finally saw Chloe, as usual, she was trying to avoid me. \nI quickly thought of something that would make her talk to me without me having to really force her. \nSomething really stupid. \nI collapsed on the floor with my eyes closed hoping that she'd fall for my stupid trick. Boy, did it work! After some minutes, she started to panic. She ran to me and knelt by my side. She buried her face in her hands, sobbing. \nSee? You have to be stupid sometimes to achieve your aim. \nI used that opportunity to grab her hand. I tightened my hold on her hand and stood up. She looked shocked, confused and angry. \nHope I didn't take it too far. \n\"You tricked me you-\" She said, raising her other hand to hit me. \nI dodged it and dragged her to the back of the house. \n\"Leave me!\" She said in an attempt to wriggle hand free from my hold. Not until I pinned her against the wall with my other hand. \nI let go of her hand, tightening my hold on her shoulders, forcing her to look at me. \n\"Why have you been avoiding me?\" I asked looking into her brown eyes. \nShe didn't reply, she just continued to stare. \n\"Answer me Chloe, what's wrong? Did Cole do anything to you? Did he tell you anything?\" I asked with emotion laced in my voice. \nShe closed her eyes and let a tear drop fall from her eyes, choking in a sob. \n\"Don't call him Cole. He's Master Cole. You must respect that name\". She said sternly. \nI rolled my eyes at her. I'm not one to follow stupid rules. \n\"He did something to you, right?\" I asked, determined to know the reason behind Chloe avoiding me. \nAfter cajoling her, she finally told me but not without making me to promise her that I'll never tell anyone. She wasn't satisfied with my promise so she made me swear on my life but I'm not so stupid... I kept my fingers crossed at my back. \nWe talked for sometime and then went our separate ways not without Chloe's repetitive apologies. \n*** \nI went back to my room and started analyzing the new information I had just gathered. It started making little sense to me. \nThough I didn't know how dangerous Cole was because Chloe hadn't really told me about pureblood vampires, I could still gather the fact that purebloods were dangerous because of Chloe's experience with Cole some nights before. \nThat was what made her to start avoiding me and honestly, I would have done the same. \nSo this was what happened... \nSomehow, Cole found out about what Chloe told me about him being a vampire and also a pureblood. This made him really upset. \nHe whipped her and harassed her sexually. She left his room with torn clothes and a swollen face. \nI have no idea why he'd do that to her. \nI mean, who does that?!? \nI felt really sorry for Chloe. \nI swear, I'd have done worse than than that if I was in the same situation. \nI'd have probably committed suicide. \nHaha, just kidding. My life's worth more than that. \nBut she didn't seem to mind the sexual harassment. She told me she had faced worse than that in the hands of her Master. \nShe didn't want me to see her like that so she started avoiding me. \nHe threatened to kill her if he ever caught her telling me anything that was supposed to be kept secret in that house. Honestly, I was kind of hurt. I hated the fact that someone that I was probably going to live with forever didn't trust me but- Who needs his trust anyways? \nI was so deep in my own thoughts that I didn't realize that someone had been knocking on my door. When I finally jolted back to life, I quickly stood up and opened the door. \nTwo heavily built men stood there looking upset probably because I made them wait long before opening the door. \n\"Hi, what do you want?\" I asked in an attempt to break the uncomfortable silence. \nThey ignored me and started packing my things. They threw my new clothes (just my red dress and a few other clothes) in a small suitcase. \n\"What are you doing?\" I asked. \n\"Taking your things to the Prince's room\" One of the men murmured. \nWHAT THE FREAKING HELL?!? \nI probably won't last a night in Cole's room. \nI'm so done for. \nAfter taking the necessary things out, one of the men turned to face me. \nHe was good looking and had this dark aura radiating him. \n\"Where's your collar and why did you take it off?\" \nA collar? \n\"I don't have a collar\". I stated. \nHe looked surprised for a second. \nWhat's so surprising? The fact that I don't have a collar? Chloe did say wearing a collar was important but I wasn't given one. \n\"O-okay, you'll be given one soon. Let's go\". He said. \nHe gripped my upper arm and practically dragged me all the way to Cole's room. \n** When we were getting closer to Cole's room, my heart seemed to race to the highest mountain and back. \nI started counting the number of minutes left- One, two, three, four..... \nWe got to the front of Cole's door. By then, I was already trembling. \n\"Wait!\" I said, holding the man's muscular arm. \nWhy the hell was I scared? \n\"What?\" He said, glaring at me. \nI swallowed hard and shook my head, allowing him to knock. \nA familiar voice said something from the other side of the room that I didn't really understand because of my state of fear. All I could grasp was that the man opened the door and dragged me inside. \nThe room was dark, not a single source of light apart from the one coming from the hallway that disappeared when the door was closed behind us. \nThe room was well lit the last time I checked. Something must have happened or maybe something is gonna happen. \nWHAT IF HE WANTED TO SUCK MY BLOOD DRY?!? \nChloe said that she was happy that he didn't suck her blood dry, what if he wanted to suck mine dry?!? \nI'm his 'pet' you know. \nI swallowed hard. \nI froze when he told the man to leave. \nOh no! Please don't leave me with him. He'll kill me. I looked at the man with pleading eyes, hoping he'd see me. He actually saw me but he only glared at me. So vampires had a very keen sight, just like I watched in the movies. \nI'll be alone with Cole now. He probably wants me dead by now. \nI'll have to go through the same painful experience that Chloe had with him. \nI'll be sexually harassed, he'll whip me, he'll suck my blood- what else? \nSay your last prayers. \n******** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nEarly update for my wonderful readers. \nHave you heard the new song by Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello? \nIf you haven't, listen to it now and watch the music video.... So romantic \ud83d\ude0d \nDon't forget to vote and comment. \nLove y'all\u2764\u2764\u2764 \nP.S. Okay, y'all should act like I never talked about the 'Se\u00f1orita' album...

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nI stood frozen at the door, waiting for Cole to walk angrily to me. Then maybe tear my clothes off or something. But he didn't do anything. \nAfter some minutes of silence, he cleared his throat. \n\"Do you want to sit or continue standing?\" He asked calmly. \n\"Huh- It depends on what you want me to do\". I said, bowing my head in fear. \" Master\". I quickly added. \nChloe had told me that every pet was required to call their owners 'Master'. \nMaybe he'll have a rethink if I act like a good little pet. Being called pet still made me cringe but it's not like I could do anything. \nHe smirked. \n\"When did Brittany become so respectful?\" He asked. \n\"I- I learnt that I have to respect you as my...m... Master\". Geez Britt, did you really have to stutter? \n\"That's really good you know\". He said. \nI didn't know if I was supposed to reply so I just simply nodded. \nHe sighed. \n\"Come here\" He said but I didn't move an inch. \nHe switched on the light. He was sitting on his king sized bed. \nI started trembling again. \n\"Sit\". He ordered. \n\"Huh, W-where?\" I asked \nHe pointed at the sofa that was a few inches away from his bed. \nI walked slowly and sat on it. \nMinutes passed by but no one was ready to start a conversation. He finally spoke up. \n\"Brittany,\" He said. \n\"Yes, M-master\" \nHe sighed again. \n\"You're scared of me, aren't you?\". He said. \n\"I- Honestly, I am\". I said. \nWe both drowned in silence. Each of us drowning in our own thoughts. \n~ \nIn the evening, Cole dropped the document he'd been working on and started walking over to me. \nI looked up at him fearfully. \nHe sighed yet another time. That was the third time since I arrived in his room. \nI was so freaked out that a little contact with him made me shout out in fear. \n\"Get away from me you blood sucking monster!\" \nWhat did I just say?!? \nHis eyes turned black. \n\"I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. I-it was a mistake...\" I rambled. \nHe closed his eyes and rubbed his temples. \n\"It's okay, really\" he said calmly before opening his eyes. \nHis eyes had gone back to their normal blue color. \nAfter that, he didn't say anything. \nThirty minutes later, he stood up and took something that looked like a leash, holding a collar in the other hand. \nHe walked to me and put the collar around my neck loosely. Then he attached the leash to the collar. \nI whimpered for no reason in particular. \n\"Is it too tight?\" He asked. \nI shook my head. \n\"I'm sorry but I have to keep this on your neck when we're outside the room, alright?\" \nI nodded. \n~ \nThere were many vampires in the dining room. \nCole sat next to a blonde haired guy while I stood beside him. \nThey served them their mouth watering food along with a glass of thick red liquid that I assumed was blood. \n\"Is this your new pet?\" The blonde guy asked Cole. \n\"Yup\" Cole replied. \nThe blonde guy smirked. \nThey served the pets bad looking vegetables. \nThe sight of the food made my stomach churn. \nA lady brought a small wooden chair for me to sit. The chair had nails sticking out on the left side so I sat on the right side. \nUnknown to me, the chair was a little bit shaky. My weight broke the chair and I fell on the floor, making a loud noise. \nEveryone around me laughed out loud as my face burned with embarrassment. \nThe same lady that gave me the chair came to pack the pieces of the chair and put another chair. I looked up at her and accessed her features. She didn't look so young but she was kind of pretty, the fact that she was hiding a smile made my face heat up. \nAfter that incident, I didn't dare to sit on any of those small squeaky little chairs. I stood till Cole was done with his meal, starving myself in the process!!! \n* After dinner, we went back to Cole's room. \nHe removed the leash and collar from my neck and removed his shirt. \n\"Ahh! Not even a warning?\" I impulsively said. \nHe smirked. \n\"Relax, it's just the upper part. Or do you want me to-\". He said. \n\"No please\". I said, not waiting for him to complete the sentence. \nI couldn't help but let my eyes travel down his bare chest. Watching as his muscles flexed when he picked up another shirt. \nMy cheeks heated up when I saw that he caught me ogling him again. \n\"Do you want to have your bath or do you want go to bed without having your bath?\" \n\"I'll have my bath please\" I said, happy that Cole was acting nice. \nI walked over to his exotic bathroom and undressed before stepping into the shower. \nAfter I had my bath, I wrapped the towel around my body and stepped out of the shower only to see Cole standing near the door. My cheeks turned red at the thought of him watching me have my bath. \n\"No worries, I just came in\". \nHe handed over a pile of neatly folded clothes to me and left. \nI put on the white underwear which surprisingly fit me perfectly. Then I put on the cotton shorts and shirt he provided. \nI stared at myself in the mirror, I realized that I didn't as bad as I thought. The dark bags under my eyes had completely disappeared and apart from being wet, my hair looked okay. \nI walked back to the room and lay on the thick cloth that had been provided for me to sleep on. \nMy mind raced through the events of today before slowly drifting to sleep. \n** \nA/N: Hey beautiful people! \nI'm not really busy now so I decided to update. \nVote and comment as a way to appreciate the early update. \nHow has summer been for you? \nAwesome right? \nThanks a lot to the people that followed me. \nTill next update. \nLove y'all \u2764\ud83d\udc97 \n\n\n"

I opened my eyes and yawned. \nI stood up and tiptoed to the only window in my 'Master's' room. The view was so beautiful. \nThe sun was starting to rise but my 'Master' was still fast asleep. \nI sighed quietly and sat on the built-in bench. \nI sat there for some time, thinking about everything that had happened the previous day. Cole- I mean 'Master' was being nice to me and I couldn't understand why . \nThe first impression I made was enough for him to hate me. \nHe was oddly calm and collected. If anyone told me that he could be that calm, I'd have taken that as a really offensive joke that was punishable by the law of the 'vampire world' Or what should I call a place where only vampires live in? \n'Master' Cole, according to what I've heard, belongs to a very dangerous breed of vampires- PUREBLOOD! \nI wouldn't have freaked out if I didn't know why vampires or people dreaded purebloods and I would have been less freaked out if I hadn't seen what purebloods could do. \nFor all I care, Cole could be pretending! \nI know that I'm being pessimistic but I care about my life and my 'Master' holds my precious life in his hands. He could kill me within half a minute and he wouldn't even feel guilty for killing me, he could - \nMy thoughts were interrupted by the sound of shuffling. \nI turned my head to see my so much dreaded 'Master' removing some pieces of paper from the table. \nI think he noticed that I was staring because he turned to me and smiled. \nI didn't return the gesture because I was still battling with two emotions; Confusion and Surprise' \nI mean, when did he wake up? How did he not make a sound when standing up? Were his footsteps so quiet that I didn't hear them? H- \n\"Morning Britt\". He greeted, interrupting my thoughts again. \n\"Morning Master Cole \". I said. \nHis expression changed the moment I greeted him. \n\"Brittany, please can we drop all formalities?\". He said. \n\"But why?\". I asked. \nHe face palmed before replying. \n\"You can keep the formalities till when we get outside but when we're alone, drop the formalities \". \n\"But why?\" I asked, repeating my previous question. \n\"I feel old when I'm called Master\" \nI wasn't convinced but I also couldn't risk getting harassed and whipped. In other words, I was really careful of what I said to him. \n\"You can speak to me casually when we're alone. You know, like the way you spoke to me the other day\". He paused and looked into my eyes before adding . \"But not as rude\". \n\"B.. But you got angry the other day because I spoke to you casually\". I said. \nHe smirked. \n\"That was casual but rude and I didn't get angry because you talked casually or rudely, I got angry because you said something about my mother\". \nHis eyes darkened for a second before turning back to its normal color, blue. \nWhat I really said that day clicked. \n'.... You must have given your mom a tough time while raising you 'cause you obviously lack manners.....' \nShit! \nBut there was nothing wrong in the statement. \nI said that because he was being a total jerk but I wasn't insulting his mom, I was insulting him so why did he get angry about me mentioning his mother? \nCole's a really mysterious vampire. \n\"Brittany,\". Cole said, snapping me out of my thoughts. \n\"Huh?\" \n\"I said I'm sorry for my reaction that day, I just don't like it when my mom's is mentioned\". \n\"It's okay, I understand and I'm also sorry for being rude but it's in my blood\". \nI didn't get rude for no reason. I was only rude to people I didn't like. \nHe chuckled. \nHe actually chuckled, this is really good. I mean, Cole chuckled! \n\"Being rude doesn't fit you\". He said. \n\"Why?\" \n\"Cause only guys like me\" He said using his hand to demonstrate. \"Can have it in their blood\". \nThere comes his ego. \n\"And who said only guys are allowed to be rude? Anyone can be rude if they want to\". I said. \n\"Yes. But sass doesn't suit all\". \n\"Whatever\". I said, not knowing what else to say. \nHe smirked again and after that, there was silence, a comfortable silence as Cole busied himself with documents. \n\"Since when did you decide to stop having your bath\" Cole asked, breaking the silence. \n\"Huh?\" I asked him in confusion. \"When did I tell you that I wasn't going to have my bath?\" \nHe shrugged. \n\"I'm just asking because you don't look like you're planning to have one soon\" \n\"I was waiting for you to have yours first\" \n\"Well, I'm still busy and breakfast's in a hour and thirty minutes, you should be done in thirty minutes\" \nI stood up and walked into his bathroom. Just as I was about to pull off my clothes, I remembered that I didn't have any clothes to wear after my bath so I went back to the room. \nI couldn't find the clothes that I wore the previous day so I decided to ask Cole since I was feeling slightly comfortable around him now.\u00e6q \n\"Um, Cole?\" I said. \nHe hummed in response. \n\"Have you seen my clothes anywhere?\" \n\"I didn't take them off for you so why would I know?\" He said with his eyes still fixed on the paper he was scribbling something on. \nI groaned in frustration. I didn't want to be rude because I was still scared of him. \nI walked back to the bathroom and pulled off my clothes. \nI planned to wear them again after my bath. \nI turned on the shower and rubbed a strawberry scented soap on my skin and washed my hair with shampoo. \nAfter the shower, I wrapped the towel around my body and picked up my clothes. \n\"You can take your clothes from the closet\". Cole said, startling me. \nI almost said 'get out' but I remembered that he was my master so I kept my mouth shut. \n\"You know, you could have just shouted that out to me\". I said. \n\"I don't want to disturb other vampires\". He said flatly. \n\"Well, the walls are sound proof\". \nChloe told me when I scolded her for not shouting for help when Cole did those awful things to her. \nI ignored the surprised look on his face and walked over to the closet. \nI opened the door that led to the walk in closet only to be graced by clothes arranged according to their color. I could do a closet tour one day. \nI almost squealed in delight. \n\"Are they all for me?\" I asked. \n\"No, my girlfriend's clothes, just take what you'd need for today. I can get another pair for her\". He said. \nMy happiness died down immediately. \n\"Oh\". I said, trying to hide the disappointment in my voice. \nHe turned to look at me and started laughing. \nIt's good to see him laugh but not when he's laughing at me. \nI frowned. \n\"What's so funny?\" \n\"The look o-on y- your f-face\". He said in between his laughter. \nMy frown deepened. \n\"What's wrong with my face?\" \n\"They're not my girlfriend's, they're all yours\". He said. \n\"You son of a-\" I stopped speaking because calling him that would mean calling his mom a bitch. \nI put my dirty clothes in the laundry and searched the closet for something that'd fit my mood. I finally picked a grey dress that stopped just below my knees and paired it up with white flats.. \nMy hair was still dripping wet but I couldn't ask Cole for a dryer or brush since he was having his bath. \nI sat on the couch and waited for Cole. \nSome minutes later, Cole came out of the bathroom with a white towel hanging loosely on his waist, making the 'V' obvious. \n\"Jeez, get dressed\". I said, shielding my eyes. \n\"But I just got out of the bathroom \". He said innocently. \n\"Just get dressed and stop talking\". \nHe walked over to his wardrobe and pulled out some clothes. \nI watched as his muscles flexed and oh my gosh, those abs and packs! \nIt's better I stop ogling him before he catches me again. \nHe unfolded a black shirt and put it on then he unfolded black pants and looked at me. \n\"Are you gonna watch me dress?\" He asked. \nI blushed and turned away. \n\"Your hair's wet, do you wanna dry it?\" He asked. \n\"Are you still dressing?\" \n\"See for yourself\". \nI closed my eyes and turned to face him. \n\"Open your eyes\". \nI slowly opened my eyes, he was dressed so I opened my eyes completely. \nI dried my hair with the hair dryer Cole gave me and packed it in a ponytail before leaving. \n********** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nI hope you enjoyed this chapter even if Cole and Brittany were the only characters in this chapter. \nIt was getting too long so I decided to cut it short. \nI hope this chapter wasn't too boring for you guys. \n* \n* Special Announcement *Shoutout* ~ Shoutout to '@purpledove321' for her awesome contributions to the growing success of this book. \n~~ \nPlease don't forget to vote and comment. \nLove y'all \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\ude18 \nThis comment may be offensive. \n\nThis comment may be offensive. \n\n"

        "chapter_content": " YOU ARE READING \nWhat happens when you're sold to a pureblood vampire? ~ Brittany, a fifteen year old girl is sold to a pureblood vampire Prince. Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nThe dining room wasn't filled with so many vampires unlike the last time. \nThe female slaves were dressed in short red dresses with long socks and black shoes today. The male slaves were dressed in red button down shirts tucked in black pants and red bow ties. \nI stood beside Cole with my head down. Cole told me not to look in any vampire's eyes because there was a special breed of vampires that had the gift of reading minds without being immortal. \nCole's food was different from the food they served others. I also noticed that Cole was treated with so much respect. \nI noticed that Chloe wasn't in the room. I hoped that all was well with her because half of the vampires weren't present in the room. \nAfter breakfast, we went back to Cole's room. \nCole busied himself with some documents while I just sat by the window, taking in the amazing view of the so called 'Vampire World' \nI didn't know what they called it so I just called it 'vampire world'. \nThere was a knock on the door. Cole turned to look at me and told me to sit on the wooden chair that was a few steps away from the sofa, closer to the in built bench. \nHe opened the door and a tall man with an aura that screamed evil came in, his eyes were burning with rage but he bowed his head in respect before speaking. \n\"Morning prince\". The man said, his voice was deep and dark. \n\"Morning. What can I do for you?\" \n\"I came here to confirm an incident that happened with my pet some days ago\" \nCole nodded and then motioned towards the sofa. \n\"Please sit\". Cole said. \nThe man sat and stared at me before looking at Cole. \n\"So what's your pet's name?\" Cole asked. \n\"Chloe Stanfield\". He said. \nCole visibly tensed. \n\"For some days now, Chloe has being acting really strange and she passed out when I drank from her yesterday\". The man said. \nI held my breath. \n\"I perceived your scent on her some days ago but she refused to tell me what really happened so I came to confirm myself\". The man continued. \n\"And what do you want to confirm?\" Cole asked between gritted teeth. \n\"Did you by chance d-drink from her?\" The man asked, stuttering a little. \nCole eyes darkened. \n\"Yes I did\". He answered, his voice had changed drastically. \n\"You see, I don't like it when other vampires drink from my pet and I'm sure you wouldn't like it if the same thing was done to your pet so-\" The man said but Cole cut him off. \n\"SHUT UP!\" Cole yelled darkly. \nWhy would this have so much effect on him? \n\"Other vampires?\" Cole asked, chuckling darkly. \n\"Were you ever taught manners?\" He asked again. \n\"Look, you're pureblood doesn't mean you can intimidate me. You drank from my pet knowing it isn't right and-\" \nIdiot, why did you say that? \nIn one swift move, he had the man pinned to the wall, his hands encircling the man's neck. \nI gasped. \n\"You had the audacity to come into my room to ramble about me drinking from your pet without fear? You even have the guts to question me. Yes, I'm a pureblood and I can do whatever I want to. Apart from that fact, I rule this whole freaking house and an entire kingdom, I'm also the next to the rule the whole freaking east region. You should have thought twice before coming here to question my actions\". He spat as he continued choking the life out of the man. \nOkay, that's the longest sentence I've heard him say. \nHis veins had also darkened. His fangs were out, his eyes were totally black. The other vampire's face was growing veins too. Cole's fangs tore off the man's skin but almost immediately, it healed like nothing had happened. \n\"Stop healing\". Cole commanded. The man didn't obey and continued healing as Cole continued doing the same thing. Frustrated, Cole pulled out a loud chunk of the man's skin, making blood spill everywhere. \nI screamed. \nHe looked at me and left the man's neck and started stalking towards me. \nI stood up and started moving backwards, knocking out the wooden chair. \nI continued moving backwards, breathing heavily. \nI looked backwards and saw that I was already near the wall. I gave up and sat on the floor, hugging my knees tightly. \nHe stopped right in front of me, by then, tears were streaming down my face. \nThe whole scene replayed in my mind. I hadn't seen so much blood. \n\"Get out!\" He yelled at the man. \nHe ran out of the room in fear. The door closed with so much force. \n\"Brittany\". He said, his voice softening a little bit. \nI whimpered. \n\"Look at me when I'm speaking to you\". He said. \nOut of fear, I looked up at him. \nHis fangs were gone, his skin was normal apart from the fact that it was still pale and his eyes were blue again. He also had blood smeared on his hand and face. \n\"I'm sorry you had to see that. I just...\" He said rubbing his face in frustration. \nI felt the urge to pull him into an embrace and tell him that I wasn't scared but that would be like lying because my fear of him had doubled. I felt like I just watched a reality horror movie. \n\"I- I just tend to lose control anytime someone talks about the wrong things I do. It makes me feel guilty but I find it hard to apologize for doing something wrong. And he talked about me being p- you know, pureblood. It just angered me so much\". He said. \n\"But you've apologized to me twice or thrice before. You just apologized again so what could be so hard in saying that you're sorry?\" I asked him, wiping the tears that were beginning to dry up on my cheeks. \n\"Everything!\" He yelled. \"I don't just say sorry to anyone, it'll make people think I'm weak but I'm not\". \n\"I don't think you're weak\". \n\"You think I told you sorry because I felt guilty? Yes I did but I said it unconsciously-\" \n\"I won't say unconsciously because you were conscious when you told me sorry a few minutes ago\". \nHe ran his hand through his hair and sighed. \n\"You don't understand\". He muttered under his breath. \n\"You need to apologize to both Chloe and her Master \". I said softly. \n\"But I can't. I never say sorry Brittany, never ever\" \n\"But you have\". \n\"I know but that's different. You're not a vampire! You don't think like other vampires do. Saying sorry to a vampire could make them- Uh, forget it\" \nThere was an awkward silence between us before he finally spoke. \n\"Will you help me?\" \n\"With what?\" \n\"Tell Chloe that I'm sorry, tell her to tell Damon that I'm sorry too\". \n(Her Master's name is Damon) \n\"You don't want them to think of you as a weakling so why would you send me to apologize? It's still the same thing\". \n\"You're right. I'll apologize but not today\" \n\"Then when will you apologize?\" \n\"I don't know, but not today\". \nNot ever. \n\"Why can't you just put your ego aside for a minute?\" I asked. \nI could tell he was really sorry for doing those horrible things to Chloe. He just couldn't put his ego aside and it annoyed me. \nHe ignored me and took my hand, helping me up. In the process, smearing my hand with blood. \n\"Oh, sorry. We'd better wash up\". He said. \n* A few hours later, Cole's cellphone rang. He picked it up and after sometime, he became tense. \nHe ended the phone call, stood up from the chair and closed the book he was reading. \nHe walked over to his wardrobe and brought out some clothes. \nI looked away as he undressed and put on the other clothes. \n\"You can look now\". He said and walked over to me. \nHe was wearing a white button down shirt and suit pants. \n\"I've been called for an urgent meeting. I'll lock you here to prevent any danger. Make sure you put off the light when it's night and make sure the curtains are down\". \n\"So when will you be back?\" \n\"Probably at night. Where I'm going is a bit far from here. Your lunch and dinner will be brought to you before I leave. There are fruits in the bag over there\". He said, pointing at a brown paper bag that was placed beside his study table. \nA few minutes later, a male slave brought my lunch and dinner in an air tight plate to make sure it remained hot till I was ready to eat it. \nCole put on his shoes and a suit jacket. \n\"Remember everything I told you\". He said. \"Also, don't open the window no matter what\". \nI nodded and then he left, locking the door behind him. \n*** \nA/N: Hey Beautiful people! \nI noticed that you guys do not comment on my story.

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nA/N : Hi guys, I decided to write Cole's POV since you didn't vote but it's cool so here is Cole's POV. \nI also added a Brittany POV to this chapter 'cause I wanted to lengthen the chapter. \nI hope you enjoy it. You may proceed.... \n*** \nCole's POV \nI pulled over at the car park of the castle. \nI wanted this meeting to end as soon as possible because the last one didn't end well. \nI couldn't leave Brittany alone in my room because of Adrian. \nI can remember him saying something about her taste. He knew her blood was rare. I couldn't risk it. \nShe's even more insecure because Adrian has the spare key with him. \nAdrian is a type of vampire that always wants more. His pets don't stay long and that's why he doesn't get pets from auction, he prefers to get them from cheap pet shops 'cause he doesn't need to spend so much money on a pet that wouldn't stay long. \nI walked into the castle, ignoring the slaves that were bearing their heads to me and walked to his office. I opened the door and walked in closing the door behind me. \n\"I thought you wouldn't come\". He said in his husky voice. \n\"What do you want?\" I asked. \n\"Hello to you too and I'm fine, thanks for asking\". He said. \nI rolled my eyes. \n\"Please sit\". He said, motioning to a chair that was directly facing his large desk. \nI hesitantly sat on the chair. \nHe sighed. \n\"Can't we forget about the past and move on?\" He said. \n\"Move on!?! Forget about the past? Seriously?! You want us to move on after you killed her?\" \n\"We all make mistakes, Nicholas Vasilios\". \nWow! He mentioned my full name. Who the hell does he think he is? \nHuh, I'll let that go. \n\"Yes but killing her couldn't have been a mistake! No one can make that mistake except you of course\". I yelled. \n\"I'm sorry, I really am but you're not ready to give me a chance, not a single chance\". \nI sighed \n\"Let's forget about this and focus on the reason why you called me here\". \nThe room was filled with silence for a while before he started speaking. \n\"Your coming of age ceremony is fast approaching so-\" He said. \n\"Oh, is this all about my coming of age ceremony?\" I asked, cutting him off. \n\"No, I assume you know what to do during the ceremony. I just want to counsel you about the responsibilities you'll have on your shoulders after the ceremony\". \nI nodded. \n\"As a Prince, your responsibilities will be like three times a normal vampire's responsibilities after the ceremony...\" \nWe talked for hours and hours in his office. The conversation was more comfortable than I imagined it to be. It didn't end up like the last time and I was grateful for that. \nI got home around 12:37 am, the house was dead silent by then. \nI got to my room that happens to be on the top floor and brought out my keys. \nI opened the door and walked in. \nI didn't bother to switch on the light because I didn't want to wake Brittany up. \nI walked to my wardrobe and removed my suit jacket and tie. I was undoing the buttons of my shirt when I heard quiet sobbing. \nI reach out to switch on the light. \n\"Brittany\". I said quietly. \nShe was curled up in a ball on a blanket with her face buried in her hands. She was visibly shaking. \n*** Brittany's POV \n\"Brittany\". He said quietly. \nAfter some minutes, I looked up at him. \n\"Cole\". I said, my voice hoarse from crying. \nHe walked over to me and studied me for some time before speaking. \n\"Who hurt you?\" He asked, anger laced in his voice. \nI shook my head. \n\"Stop lying to me Britt, I hate it\". He said. \n\"I'm not lying\". I said, trying my best to stop tears from streaming down my face. \n\"Then what happened?\" He asked. \nI shook my head in an attempt to shake off the memory of the nightmare but it kept coming and all it was all about my mom's death. \nI kept seeing fire, my mom crying and running to save a baby that I assume was me, my dad running after her and then a scream and then everything went blank but it was still scary. \nI didn't know how my mom died and dad refused to tell me. All I know is that she died when I was a little baby. \nI woke up sweating profusely and I felt like jelly, my body was shaking uncontrollably. \nCole grabbed my hand in an attempt to help me stand but I withdrew my hand, I was still shocked. \nI seldom had nightmares and if I ever had nightmares they were always about a monster taking away my ice cream and I would wake up and make my dad buy three giant scoops of ice cream for me the next day. But that was a stupid thing I did when I was five! \nNow the scary nightmares have started to haunt me with one of my weaknesses, my mom. I'm turning sixteen this year for crying out loud! \nI buried my face in my hands again and sighed. \nI heard footsteps approaching but I ignored it and continued thinking. \nI felt someone lifting me. I opened my eyes too see Cole carrying me in bridal style. \n\"What are you doing? Put me down!\" \n\"You didn't want to move so I had to carry you and I'm putting you down\". He said. \nHe put me on his king size bed. \n\"You can sleep if you want to\". \nI attempted to stand up but he stopped me. \n\"My bed is big enough for both of us so I'll sleep on one end and you'll sleep on the other\" \n\"Sorry, WHAT?!?\" I said. \"There's no way I'm sleeping on my master's bed\" \n\"Huh, we're back to the Master terms again? And yes, you're sleeping on my bed\". \nWith that, he switched off the light. \nI just couldn't sleep, the nightmare was haunting me and I was on the same bed with my Master. My life was gradually turning into a big mess. \nI turned to look at Cole and analyzed his features. His face looked calm while sleeping. He looked so peaceful and- \n\"Like what you see?\" Cole asked, opening his eyes. \nI rolled my eyes. \n\"Can't sleep huh?\" He asked. \nI hummed in response. \nHe opened his mouth to talk but I beat him to it. \n\"I don't wanna talk about it\". \n\"Uh, okay. What can I do to help?\" \nI shook my head. \n\"I dunno\". I said. \nSurprisingly, he pulled me into an embrace and ran his hands through my hair. \n\"What are you doing?\" I asked sleepily. \n\"I dunno. I'm just doing it\". He said, still running his hands through my hair. \nI closed my heavy eyes and fell asleep after some minutes. \n*** A/N: Hey Beautiful people! \nI hope you like the combination of both Brittany and Cole's POVs. \nWho do you think Cole's dad killed? \nThe person that gets it right gets a shoutout! \nDon't forget to vote and comment. \nLove y'all\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc96 \n\n\n"

I thought as I opened my eyes, trying to adjust to the amount of sunlight coming from the window. \nMemories from yesterday came flooding back. I was actually in Cole's bed, I slept in Cole's bed! \nIt wasn't actually yesterday because Cole came back after midnight. \nI looked at the small digital clock on Cole's bedside table. \n\nCole was not on the bed, he'd probably gone for another meeting. \nI stood up and rubbed my eyes. \nJust as I was about to walk into the bathroom, the bathroom door opened and a shirtless Cole stood before me. \nDo you always have to do this?!? I thought. \n\"Do you always have to do this?\" I asked, voicing out my thoughts and also shielding my eyes. \n\"Well, morning to you too and what did I do?\" He asked, walking to his wardrobe. \nI rolled my eyes. \n\"Do you always have to come out shirtless?\" I said. \n\"What?\" He asked innocently. \"Or did I get you turned on?\" \nThis guy was unbelievable!!! \n\"What?!? Hell No!!!\" \n\"Are you sure?\" He asked, wriggling his eyebrows. \n\"Huh, just get dressed\". I said, walking into the bathroom. \nI closed the door behind me and saw a new set of toothbrush and paste. \n\"Are they for me?\" I yelled. \n\"What?!\" He yelled back. \n\"The toothbrush and paste\". \n\"Yes!\" \nJeez! I haven't brushed in days! \nHow was Cole or anyone else comfortable around me?!? \nI put a small amount of paste on the new brush and brushed my teeth like I hadn't brushed in years. \nAfter brushing my teeth, I had my bath and then I realized I didn't bring my clothes again! I always forgot. \nI wrapped the towel securely around my body and walked into the bedroom. \nCole was sitting by his study table by then. He barely noticed my presence so I quietly walked to the closet and picked out a white tank top and black jean pants. \n\"Do you always have to do this?\" Cole asked, mimicking what I said earlier. \n\"What?\" \n\"Coming out of the bathroom with a towel being the only thing hiding your body\". \nI blushed stupidly. \n\"Wh- What are you saying?\" I asked. \n\"Why are you cheeks red?\" He asked teasingly. \nI waved him off and walked to the bathroom. \nI got dressed and walked back to the bedroom. \nI dried my hair and tied it up in a rough bun and then went to sit by the window. \nAs time went by, I started getting hungry but Cole was still busy with whatever he was doing. \nI decided to bring up small talk with him. \n\"Do you ever watch TV?\" I asked. \n\"No. Why?\" He said, not looking up. \n\"Like you seriously don't watch TV? Do you have one here?\" \n\"Do you want to watch TV? If you do, then I'll take you to my office when I'm done with this\". \nHe has an office? Wow! \n\"You have-\" \n\"Enough questions already. I'm trying to concentrate here\". He said, cutting me short. \n\"Oh, okay\". I said. \nHours passed by and he was finally done. \nHe stood up and walked over to me. \n\"You must be hungry\". He said, sitting beside me. \nI nodded. \n\"I'll order your food, okay?\". \n\"Okay\". I said. \nHe picked up his cellphone and dialed a number, the receiver picked up at the second ring. \n\"Bring my food to my room\". He said and ended the call. \nA few minutes later, there was a knock on the door. \nI stood to open it but he beat me to it. \nHe took the food from the slave and closed the door. \nHe walked back to me and handed over the food to me. \nWhy would he give me his food? \n\"Huh, this is your food\". I said. \n\"And I'm giving it to you\". He said. \n\"Um, thanks\". \nThe food tasted superb. \nThe vampires here were different from the ones in the movies or books. \nAccording to what I learnt from the movies, vampires do not eat human food but the vampires here eat like humans do. \nThere are a lot of things about the vampires here that I still didn't understand. \n* After eating, I thanked Cole for the food and went back to the window. \nI was getting used to that. \nMy mind went back to the last thing that I'd want to think of. \nMy nightmare. \nIt still scared the crap out of me. \nIt was like the nightmare was trying to tell me something that I couldn't understand. \nSince I wasn't told about the cause of my mom's death, I didn't have the slightest clue. \nA tap on my shoulder brought me back to reality. \nI turned to look at Cole. \n\"What's wrong?\" He asked. \nI only shook my head. \n\"Lying again uh?\" He said. \nI remained silent. \n\"Is it about the nightmare?\" He asked. \nHow'd he know? I don't remember telling him. \nI nodded. \n\"And you don't want to talk about it?\" \nI shook my head. \nHe sighed. \n\n\n"

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nA/N: Double update for my lovely readers\ud83d\ude18 \nOnce the make-up artiste was done with doing my make up, I put on the pearl necklace that Cole had chosen for me. \nThe makeup was minimal. Not too much but it was still done nicely. \nI was looking a little bit too overdressed for a pet. \nCole gave the make-up artiste her bills and she left the room. \nHe smiled at me. \nHe was wearing a black suit, black pants, a white shirt, a red tie and black shoes to match. \nHe looked gorgeous. \nHe opened a drawer and brought out something. A collar, a new collar. \nIt was a leather collar with diamond studs all over it. \nIt was pretty, I liked it. \nIt had my name on it. \n\"Do you like it?\" He asked. \nI nodded. \nHe put the collar loosely around my neck and attached the leash to the hook at the front of my collar. \nI looked at myself in the mirror. \nI looked pretty in the red dress. My hair was curled, the necklace was beautiful, the collar was also beautiful. \n\"Oh, one more thing\". Cole said. \nHe brought out a rose hair pin and clipped it on my hair to put the stray strands in place. \nI smiled at him. \n\"Just so you know, I may act different\". He whispered and held my leash before opening the door. \nHow different? \n* The hall was filled with many people. \nCole tugged on my leash a little bit harshly. Maybe that meant I should walk faster. \nI increased my walking pace. \nHe greeted some of his friends and then a voice that sounded like Cole's voice rang in my head. \n'Go into that room, other pets are there' \nI turned to look at Cole but he was already looking at me. \nWow! Telepathy! \nSo vampires do have abilities. \n'Of course, dumbass, you knew that a long time ago' \nHe released my leash and left. \nI was expecting the normal number of pets that I knew but the room was filled with hundreds of pets. \nI should have known that when I saw the number of vampires present at the party. \nThe room was so stuffy that I could hardly breath. \nI looked around and saw that I was actually the odd one out. \nI was overdressed. \nAll my excitement about showing off my dress immediately died down. I started to feel uncomfortable. \nOther female pets wore clothes that revealed most part of their body. \nSome wore only oversized shirts and singlets, some wore lingeries while some where barefooted. \nI looked around for the pets that I was more familiar with and finally spotted Chloe talking to Kyle. \nShe was wearing a sleeveless blue dress with plain black flats. She had her hair tied up in a ponytail but she looked pale. \nKyle wore a gray T-shirt, worn out jean pants and a pair of sandals. \n\"Hi guys\". I said. \nThey turned to look at me. \nTheir eyes widened. \n\"Oh my gosh Britt, you look amazing!\" Chloe gushed. \n\"Wow! Your Master must be taking really good care of you\". Kyle said. \n\"Thanks guys. I missed you a lot\". I said. \n\"I missed you too\". Chloe said. \n\"Yeah, me too\". Kyle said. \n\"We all hang out in the garden now. You don't come out of your room that much lately, what happened?\" Chloe asked. \n\"Everything is fine. Cole mostly orders for my food now\". I said before I realized my little slip up. \n\"Cole?\" Chloe asked. \n\"Sorry, I meant Master Cole.\" I said quickly. \n\"You're lucky he isn't here, you would have gotten punished for not calling him 'Master\". Kyle said quietly. \nPunishment? He doesn't even want to be called Master. \nI would have said that but instead I said, \n\"It's a good thing he isn't here then\". I said, chuckling nervously. \n\"Sonia! Over here!\" Chloe said, waving at Sonia. \nSonia made her way to where we were standing. \nShe was wearing an oversized shirt and flip-flops. \nI felt bad for her especially when she looked at my dress. She looked sad. \n\"Hi\". She said to us. \n\"Hi\". We replied in unison. \n\"Brittany, where have you been?\" She asked. \nHer Master didn't seem to be treating her well. \n\"In my master's room\". I replied casually. \n\"What?!? They all said. \n\"Um, Co- Master Cole moved me to his room\". I said, looking down. \nI didn't like the look in their eyes. \n\"So is this all for pretence?\" Chloe asked. \n\"Huh?\" I asked. \n\"The dress and everything\". She said. \n\"No, not at all\". I said \n\"Then I guess I'm missing out on a lot of things\". Chloe said, dragging my hand and leading me to a long table filled with assorted food. \nOthers followed behind. \n\"So-\" Chloe said, expecting me to tell her about everything that has happened in Cole's room but I said something else instead. \n\"Um, Chloe, Master Cole's really sorry for treating you like that, he really is\". I said. \nI know he was supposed to apologize but again, it may be a little bit humiliating for him considering his ego. \nSo I'm helping him to apologize to Chloe but he'll have to apologize to her Master. \n\"Prince Cole? Apology? Those are two words that can never be placed together in a sentence\". \n\"So why will Prince Cole apologize to Chloe?\" Kyle asked quietly. \n\"Because he's sorry\". I replied. \n\"He's never sorry\". Sonia said quietly. \n\"But now he's truly sorry\". I said. \n\"I won't believe that\". Chloe said. \n\"But do you at least forgive him?\" I asked. \n\"I don't know\". She said. \n\"But he's sorry\". I said, making sure my voice was quiet. \nWe were all speaking in hushed tones. \n\"I don't know if he really felt sorry, it's hard to believe\". She said. \n\"Just think about it\". I said. \n\"He's been nice since I moved to his room. I wouldn't have believed that he could hurt you like that if I hadn't witnessed him losing his temper\". I continued. \n\"Wow! Describe the word 'nice\". Kyle said. \n\"Guys, I'm starving\". Sonia finally said, changing the subject. \nThanks so much, Sonia. \n\"We've got lots of time to talk about him but we aren't going to be served this type of food everyday and other pets are also really hungry\". She continued. \nWith that being said, we took plates and served ourselves enough food and took small chairs from the stack of chairs in the room. \nI checked my chair before sitting on it, I couldn't let what happened the last time to happen this time. \nHalf way through the meal, Cole stormed in, looking really angry. \nHis almost black eyes proofed that fact. \n\"Pet!\". He yelled as everywhere became eerily silent. \nI stood up and walked over to him. \nMany pets looked at me with sympathy. \nThat was like the first time he called me 'pet' considering the fact that he never spoke to me in public and he addressed me as Brittany when we were alone. \n\"We're leaving\". He said, attaching the leash to my collar and then we left. \n*** \nA/N: Hey beautiful people! \nThe coming of age ceremony is coming really soon! \n\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7 I'm like really annoyed right now.

Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nA/N: So here's the twelfth chapter of MVL. \nYou may proceed... \n*** \"What the hell was that Cole?\" I asked in anger. \nI was having a good time with other pets. The fun was just about to begin and then he ended it. \n\"Watch your mouth, pet!\" He yelled, gritting his teeth in anger. \n\"Oh, so I'm the pet now?\"  I asked. \nHis face softened a bit. \n\"I- I didn't mean it like that\". He said, looking away. \n\"So what's with the outburst?\" I asked. \nHe sighed, running a hand through his hair. \n\"My father, he- he called\". \n\"So?\" \n\"He said he wants to see me and - he said I should bring you with me\". \nFear gripped me. \n\"Why?\" \n\"I don't know, I honestly don't know\". \n\"Why are you so scared?\" I asked. \n\"I don't know what to expect? He can do anything. Anything! He's the king, he gets whatever he wants anytime he wants it!\" \n\"Oh, about that, you never told me that you were a prince\". I said accusingly. \nI knew he was a prince from day one but I just wanted to know why he didn't really seem to like being a prince. So I just started the conversation like that. \n'Dumbass'. My subconscious mocked, but I ignored it. \n\"I didn't tell you because it wasn't necessary and you wouldn't deny the fact that you knew that a long time ago\". He said. \n\"Yeah, yeah, it wasn't necessary\". I said. \n\"Britt, I don't want you to act differently because of that, okay?\" \n\"I won't. But why did you hide it from me?\". \n'You weirdo! Why can't you drop the subject? You knew he was a freaking prince since the first day you got here!!!' \n\"Um- I didn't want you to act like others\". \n\"I'm not one of them and I'll never be alright?\" \nHe nodded. \nThis seemed like the right time to bring up the real reason why I started talking about him being a Prince so I pressed further. \n\"So-\" I said, sitting down. \"You're a- you're a um-\" \nI was scared to talk about it. Saying it has always lighted the sparks of anger in him. \n\"I'm a...\" He pressed. \n\"You're a- pureblood...?\" I said quickly, trying to get him to say more about being a pureblood. \nHe did seem uncomfortable about it. \nHis eyes darkened for a second then softened a bit. \n\"Yes\". He replied. \n\"Why did you get angry when Chloe told me that you're a pureblood?\" \nHe ran his hand through his hair. He has been doing that a lot recently. \n\"Do you have any idea how dangerous purebloods are?\" He asked. \n\"No?\" \nMy reply sounded more like a question. \n\"Purebloods are the most dangerous vampire species so everyone's scared of purebloods, especially the royal purebloods\". \nWell, that explains a lot. \n\"I didn't want you to know because I didn't want you to be scared of me like every other person\". He continued. \n\"But you're not scary to me\". \n\"Even now?\" He asked. \n\"Not a bit\". \nI never knew he'd do what he did next. \nHe pulled me into an embrace. \nSecond time. \n\"Thank you\". He whispered. \n\"For what?\" I asked. \n\"For not being like others\". He said. \nSo vampires do have feelings, at least this vampire does. \nI pulled out of the embrace. \n\"Now can we go back to the party?\" I asked. \n\"I don't know-\" He said indecisively. \n\"Please...\" I said, using my puppy dog eyes. \n\"Okay, fine\". He said in defeat. \nHa! Are you really a vampire? You shouldn't have fallen for that easily. \nHe attached my leash to my collar.  I smoothened my dress then we headed back to the party. \n*** \n\"What happened?\" Chloe asked me. \n\"I dunno. He didn't tell me\". I lied. \n\"Did he do anything to you?\" \n\"He didn't. I said. \n\"He could still-\". Chloe said but I cut her short. \n\"He won't\". \n\"Don't be so sure\". Kyle said. \nThey were serving dessert now. \n\"Let's hang out tomorrow. In the garden, by 2pm\". Kyle suggested. \n\"I'm in\". Sonia said. \n\"Me too\". I said. \n\"Me three\". Chloe said. \nOther pets were going out of the room to dance so the the room was spacious enough for us to dance. \nWe danced and drank to our satisfaction. I forgot I was underage. \nI was feeling really tipsy and my head was really light. Probably vodka effects. \nI mean, the pets were allowed to take vodka, which was rare so why not?! \nI walked up to Andrew. \n\"Hey, you're Andrew right?\" I asked. \nHe nodded. \n\"Are you dumb or something? You never speak\". \nHe looked confused. \n\"I've never heard you speak\".  I said, hitting his chest. \n\"I speak only when I have to\". He said. \n\"Wow! The dumb guy speaks!\" I said. \n\"I'm not dumb\". He said. \n\"Yes you are!\" I yelled for no particular reason. \n\"Whatever. I'm not going to keep on arguing with you\". He said, walking away. \n\"Don't you dare walk out on me ever again!!!\" I said, dragging him back. \nI inched my face closer to his and watched his eyes widen. He thought I was going to kiss him. \nSo you want a kiss now, huh? \n\"Dumb guy, I'm not going to kiss you\". I said, pulling away. \n\"Britt! You're drunk!\" He said, scrunching up his nose. \n\"Yay! He knows my name!\" \n\"Come here!\" He said, grabbing my arm. \n\"Leave me you manwhore! Where are you taking me?\" \nOkay, why did I call him a manwhore? \nHe sighed and took me to sit on one of the chairs. \n\"Wait for me, I'll be right back\". He said and left. \nWhile waiting for the dumb guy, I saw a bottle of alcohol on the floor next to my chair. \nI picked it up and gulped down a large amount of alcohol. \n\"Hey, that was mine\". A rough looking guy said. \n\"How was I supposed to know?\" I said, standing up and walking away further into the room. \n\"Brittany!\" Cole yelled. \n\"What do you want? Go and enjoy your fancy party\". I said, not looking back. \nHe spun me around and dragged me by my wrist, pulling me out of the pet room and away from the party. \n*** \n\"Why did you drink this much?\" Cole asked, scrunching up his nose in disgust. \nI was on his bed, ready to sleep. \n\"I had fun and I still want to have moooore fun but Master Cole won't let me!\" I yelled. \nThe expression on his face changed slightly. Probably because I called him Master. \nHe opened his mouth to says something but I didn't want to hear so I turned around, my back facing him and closed my eyes to sleep. \nBefore I finally fell asleep, I heard him sigh and whisper 'goodnight'. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nI'm sorry for the short chapter. I'll make next chapter longer. \nErmm, I don't know how a drunk person acts so pardon my writing. \nLove y'all\ud83d\ude18 \n\n\n"

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \n\"Uh!\" I groaned as my eyes adjusted to the amount of sunlight coming from the window. \nMy head was aching severely. \nThere was this stench of alcohol and vomit coming from me. A really disgusting smell. \nI remember that I spewed out all the alcohol I drank yesterday on myself and Cole's body. \nI couldn't piece my memories of yesterday together. My memory of yesterday was all over the place.The only thing that was still vivid in my mind was puking on my body and Cole's body. \nAlso, I remembered that Kyle told us to hang out in the garden by 2pm... Wait, 2PM!!!! \nGosh, what time was it now? \nI looked at the digital clock on Cole's bedside table. \n\nOh my, I needed to brush my teeth, have my bath and get dressed up in twenty one minutes! It was going to take forever to get the alcohol and vomit stench off my body. \nI rushed into the bathroom to brush my teeth and have my bath. Fortunately, the horrible stench of alcohol was gone after I had my bath for like fifteen minutes which was clearly not enough but I didn't have time. \nI rushed to the closet and picked a random T-shirt and denim shorts along with a pair of toms. \nI dried my hair and packed it in two rough buns. \nI was about to go out when Cole opened the door. \n\"Woah! Slow down\". He said. \"Where are you going?\" \n\"I'm going to the garden to hang out with my friends. Can I go? I haven't talked to them in such a long time\". \n\"Wait, you have friends?\" He asked. He was clearly surprised. \n\"Durrh, yes\". I said, rolling my eyes. \n\"Don't you think I need to know these friends of yours?\" \n\"Uh, you know them, the other pets, Kyle, Sonia, Chloe and Andrew\". \n\"So now they're your friends? How did you become friends with them?\" \nUh, Cole, I was already late. I needed to end this conversation. \n\"It's a long story, I'm getting late alright? Can I go now?\" I asked. \n\"Just be back before dinner- Wait!\" He yelled. \n\"You're not wearing your collar! Do you have to be this careless? Come here\". He said. \n\"Oh, I totally forgot\". I said. \nHe took out a black leather collar with silver studs from his chest of drawers. \n\"How many do you have in there?\" I asked. \n\"I dunno\". He replied, shrugging his shoulders. \nHe put the collar around my neck, making it a bit loose. \n\"Make sure you stay safe\". He whispered in my ear in a sexy kind of way. \nI gulped and nodded before leaving. \n*** \n\"Guys, I'm sorry I'm late. I woke up late and_\". I blabbed. \n\"Slow down Britt, it's okay\". Kyle said. \n\"You drank so much last night. Aren't you having a hangover or something?\" Chloe asked. \n\"My head's aching like crazy\". I said, rubbing my temples. \n\"Sorry, we can't do anything to help your hangover. They don't give us anything to relieve hangovers and we don't have freedom to-\". Chloe said. \n\"Thanks. I guess I have to deal with it myself\". I said, cutting her off. \nShe nodded. \nI looked around. \n\"Where's Andrew?\" I asked. \n\"He's supposed to be here in a few minutes\". Kyle said. \n\"He seems pretty quiet-\". I said. \n\"Yeah, he's passing through a lot with his Master. She's a female vampire with no emotions whatsoever\". Sonia said quietly but angrily. \n\"Wait, we can't be the only pets in this house. Many vampires live here so where do the other pets stay?\" I asked. \n\"I thought you'll never ask. We're royal pets so we have to stay in a different side of the house from other pets. We're treated better than they are\". Chloe said. \n\"Really? C- can I see them?\" I asked. \n\"Of course. We'll go when Andrew arrives. We'll be safe with our collars on\". Sonia said. \n*** \nWe walked down a rather unfamiliar hallway. Where else did I not know in this house? This house was so big! \nWe passed through a large door that led to another set of rooms. At the end of the long hallway, there was a large red door. \n\"This is it\". Chloe said. \nWith that, she pushed the large door open. About ninety heads turned to look at us. \n\"Sonia!\" Someone shouted. \nSonia waved at whoever it was. \nShe sighed. \n\"This is where I belong\". She said. \n\"Huh?\" I asked, tilting my head sideways. \n\"Um- Britt?\" Chloe called out. \n\"Huh?\" \n\"Sonia doesn't belong to a royal vampire. He's the head of the noble vampires. That's why she has a little freedom\" Chloe said. \n\"Oh,\". I said, admiring the place. \nWow! I'd have never known this place existed in the house. \n\"This is so cool\". I said in awe. \n\"Really? You think so?\" Sonia asked. \n\"Yeah. I mean, what's better than interacting with humans instead of being stuck with boring vampires?\" \n\"But you guys enjoy the luxury of being a royal pet. The food, clothing, everything\" Sonia said. \n\"I get it but the pets are served the same food\". I said. \n\"No. The pets are being punished for an offence they committed a week before you came. The punishment ends in two days though\". Chloe said. \"Royal pets were included in the punishment, new or not\". \n\"What was the offence?\" I asked. \n\"Some pets were said to be conspiring against their masters. Not all the pets were caught so they killed the ones they caught and punished all pets... To serve as a lesson\". Chloe said. \n\"They killed them?\" I asked in shock. \nChloe nodded. \n\"That's cruel\". I said. \n\"So the normal food is healthier?\" I asked. \n\"Yeah. The amount of food given to the Royal pets is more than the food given to regular pets\". She explained. \n\"Oh, so what do you do around here?\" I asked. \n\"Nothing much. We play poker, share stories about our normal lives before becoming pets and do other fun things\". She said. \n\"Is that all?\" I asked. \nShe nodded. \n\"Let's head back to the garden then\". I said. \nCole didn't know that I was here. He might get angry if he discovers that I came here without his permission. \n\"Are you sure?\" She asked. \nI nodded. \n\"I'd really love to stay here and socialize but my master doesn't know that I'm here so-\" I said. \n\"Wait a minute,\" I said. \"Where did Kyle, Andrew and Sonia go?\" I asked. \n\"Probably hanging out with their friends\". She said shrugging. \n*** \"Let go of me you blood sucking monster!\" I yelled. \nA random vampire had seen me and Chloe when we were walking back to our part of the house, he forced us into his room and locked the door. \nHe seemed oddly familiar but I couldn't remember where I'd seen him, not in the state I was in. \nWe tried to escape but he caught us when Chloe was trying to open the door. \nHe didn't even mind the fact that our collars were still on. He just sank his fangs into Chloe's neck and now he wanted to do the same to me. \nHe sniffed my neck and growled. \n\"A rare type\". His low and husky voice said. \n\"Don't try anything nasty or I'll-\" \nHe didn't let me end what I was saying before grabbing my neck. \nI gasped for breath. \n\"You'll do what, huh? Tell me, what will you do?\" He asked. \nTears clouded my vision. \nHe ran his tongue over my neck before sinking his fangs deep into my skin. \nI heard my own shrill scream as I gasped for air. Tears ran down my face as my vision became blurry. All I could hear was my gasp and his low growls of satisfaction before my vision became pitch black. \n*** \nA/N: Hey beautiful people! \nDouble update for you guys\ud83d\ude0a \nWho do you think this random vampire is? \nComment the answer before proceeding to the next chapter. \n~ \nI'd have loved to write the coming of age process but I've got no idea on how to write it\ud83d\ude41 \nThat's why I wanted to skip the coming of age process. \nBut if you want me to write the coming of age process, feel free to give me ideas. \nI'm already considering skipping it so if you guys don't give me ideas, I may as well skip it. \nTill next update. \nLove y'all\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\ude18            \n\n\n"

The cover is posted above^^ \nThe chapter's gonna begin with a little flashback to Chapter 12 in Cole's POV. \nYou may proceed... \n*** Cole's POV \nI pushed past the crowd as I searched for Brittany. \nA pet had informed me that she was drunk. \nI spotted her walking further into the room with a bottle of alcohol in her hands. \n\"Brittany!\" I yelled. \n\"What do you want? Go and enjoy your fancy party\". She didn't even look at me. \nI took fast steps as I approached her and grabbed her wrist and dragged her out of the miserable party. \n* \"Let go of me you beast\". Brittany said as I dragged her down the hallway. \nI stopped in my tracks and held her wrist tightly. \n\"What did you just call me?\" I asked through gritted teeth. \n\"I called you a-\" She stopped mid-way and gagged. \nThe next thing I knew was the disgusting smell of vomit spilling all over my face and shirt. \nI cursed under my breath. \n\"What was that for? Do you have any idea how dis-\" \nVomit spilled all over my face and shirt, AGAIN!!! \nI wiped the vomit on my face with the back of my hand. Gross. \n\"Stop puking all over my face, will you?!?\" I yelled. \nThere was a flash of hurt in her eyes but she quickly covered it up with a plain face. Showing no emotions. \n\"It's not like it's my fault\". \n\"Well, I wasn't the person that wanted to go back to the party and I'm certainly not the person that took too much alcohol not even minding the fact that I'm underage!\" I yelled. \nShe flinched at the tone if my voice. \nMy expression softened a bit. I wasn't going to let my anger take the best of me. \n\"I'm underage. Sorry, I forgot that\". She said, laughing humorlessly. \n\"I'm also sorry for puking all over your face and shirt\". She said, her voice held no emotions whatsoever. It sounded so dangerous. \"I didn't mean to\". \nShe said and started to walk away. \nI grabbed her arm, restricting her from moving further. \n\"I- I'm- uh,\". I said, stuttering in a weak attempt to say sorry. \n\"You...\" She pressed. \n\"I apologize\". \nI hated the word 'sorry', but I kept saying it to Brittany. \nIt's a good thing I was too angry to tell her sorry. \n\"Step away\". She said, crouching. \n\"Why?\" I asked. \n\"Do you want to get puked on again?\" She asked. \nI quickly stepped away. \nAfter like thirty seconds, she puked all over herself and on the floor. \n\"You shouldn't have drank so much\". I said. \n\"I know\". She replied. \n*** After making sure Brittany wouldn't puke again, I put her on the bed. \nShe'd clean herself up in the morning. I didn't think she'd like it if I helped her clean up. \nI walked to the bathroom and scrubbed myself like I hadn't had my bath in the past one hundred years. \nThe feeling of vomit on me was totally disgusting. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nThat's a flash back.... Yeah, I know, the chapter is reeeeally short, Next chapter will be longer and will be coming soon. \nP.S : I'm making some corrections on previous chapters. I've made some corrections in chapter 1. You should check it out but if you've already done that, then you don't need to. \nI'll notify you guys when I make corrections on other chapters. \nI didn't proof read this chapter so I'm sorry for any mistakes. \nPlease Vote and Comment. \nLove y'all\ud83d\ude18 \n\n\n"

Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nA/N: Alright guys, back to Brittany's POV. \nAfter she fell unconscious. \n*** \nOpening my eyes felt really painful but I managed to do that anyways. \nI looked beside me only to see Cole's beautiful blue eyes staring at me. \nHe looked angry and relieved at the same time. \n\"You're awake!\". He said. \n\"I sure am\". I said, standing up. \nI walked to the bathroom to rinse my face. \nI spotted the mark of fangs on my neck. \nI touched spot where he bit me and flinched at the pain. \nWow! It still hurts. \nI looked really pale. Dark circles under my eyes with my hair in a total mess. \nI needed a really good bath. \nI walked back to the room to pick my clothes. \nI searched the closet and picked out a T-shirt and jean pants along with my underwear. \nI had a long shower and brushed my teeth. \nI put on my clothes and walked back to the room with my hair still dripping wet. \nI had a feeling that Cole was going to talk about what happened. \nHe was still on the bed relaxing. \nHe was putting on a white T-shirt with black pants. His hair was kinda messy probably because he ran his hand through it several times. \nI must admit, he looked pretty hot. \n\"Like what you see huh?\" He said wriggling his eyebrows. \nI rolled my eyes. \n\"Get the hair dryer and other things from the drawer there\". He said, pointing at a chest if drawers. \nI dried my hair and straightened it to avoid talking to Cole. \n\"Britt, we need to talk\". He said after some minutes of silence. \nOkay, I knew this was coming. \n\"Why did you go to the other side of the house?\" \nHe wasted no time in going straight to the point. \n\"Um, I wanted to see the other side of the house\". \nI couldn't come up with a better excuse. \n\"Do you have any idea how dangerous going there is?!?\" He asked. \nThe anger he'd been trying to suppress escalated. \n\"B- but I went with other pets\". I defended. \n\"Did you ask me? I only allowed you to go to the garden not the other side of the house!!\" He yelled. \nI could tell he was really angry 'cause his eyes were already turning a deeper shade. \n\"I- I'm sorry. I didn't know it'd be dangerous for me to go there. I t- thought I was safe especially because I was wearing my c- collar\". \nI stuttered in fear and hurt. \nI hate being yelled at. \nHis eyes softened a little bit. Only a little bit. \n\"Your collar? You think your collar would save you?!? You should know your place by now!\" He yelled. \nYeah, as a pet. \nI've forgotten who I really am. I'm nothing but a pet. \nI got too carried away with the nice treatment from Cole. \nI was beginning to feel like I was a princess but I was nothing but a mere pet with no value. \nMy eyes were glassy with tears. \nIt was taking so much effort to stop the tears from falling. \n\"Yeah, I'm a pet with no value\". I said, my voice cracking a bit. \nI felt Cole's cold hands on mine. \nI flinched at the feeling of his cold hands on me. \n\"I didn't mean that Britt, I was too angry. I let my-\". He said. \n\"No, you're right. I've forgotten my place. I've forgotten that I'm just a mere pet\". I spat. \n\"Britt,\" \n\"I'll always remember my place Master Cole. I'll always remember that I'm a pet\". I said. \nWith that, I stood up, spread my blanket on the floor and lay on it. \nAfter making sure that I wasn't facing Cole, I let my tears fall as I sobbed silently. \nI didn't want him to think that I was weak. I'd let my guard down before. \n*** * * *** \nCole's POV \nI felt like shit! \nI let my anger take control once more and I said terrible things to Brittany. \nHer silent sobbing had stopped. \nSo that means she's asleep. \nShe slept on her blanket tonight. I decided to let her have her space. I'll sort things out with her later. \nI hate to admit it but I actually miss seeing her peaceful face in sleep with her cute snores and the warmth coming from her body. \nCole, what the hell? What are you saying?!?? \nA voice said at the back of my head. \nIt hurts to say the truth but I actually miss all those things. \nI don't know why and I don't want to know why but it's the truth. \nWe have just three weeks till we go to see my dad. \nI'm dreading it so much and I wouldn't want to think about it now. \nI have to discuss it with Brittany but we aren't really in good terms right now. \nAnd my coming of age ceremony is something I also didn't want to think about so I closed my eyes, waiting for sleep to overcome me. \n*** A/N : Hey beautiful people! \nI know it's short but I didn't break my promise of making it longer than the last one. I'm still sorry for the short chapter. \nI kind of like it. \nPlease Vote and Comment. \nLove y'all\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc96   \n\n\n"

Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nBrittany's POV \n*** \nI've been ignoring Cole for like two weeks now. \nIt's not like he even tried to talk to me... \nThe only thing that kept me entertained was writing songs. \nBefore I was sold as a pet, I used to love music. Don't get me wrong, I still love music but I really didn't have the chance to write songs or even sing. But now I had the chance to do all that now that Cole hardly came to his room. \nHe didn't let me hang out with my friends so all I did was sit by the window and write songs. \nI'd always thought of asking Cole to take me to his office so I could watch TV but seeing Cole always made all my  courage vanish. \nIt was evening now and I was writing another song on a piece of paper. \nI had written five songs now... I just had to find the perfect tune for them. \nI always hid my papers in an empty box I found in the closet when I was trying out my outfits, that time, I was bored out of my mind. \nGetting the paper wasn't my problem, Cole had a lot of them. \nDid I forget to add that Cole has been locking me in the room any time he isn't there? \nYeah, he's been doing that too. He doesn't trust me enough to leave the door open. \nWhen I was done with writing my song, I hid it in the box and kept the box safely...  I also made sure that none of my papers were lingering around because Cole's a lowkey neat freak. \nAlmost immediately after I was done cleaning everywhere up, Cole came in. \nI silently walked to the sofa and sat, careful not to make the slightest noise. \nI continued singing songs in my head to distract myself while Cole was busy doing whatever he was doing. \nThe sofa dipped. I froze instantly. \n\"Britt,\" Cole said. \n\"Y- yes Master\". I stuttered. \n\"I've told you that I didn't mean what I said to you. I didn't mean it, I promise. I said it out of anger-\" \n\"But it's the truth. I forgot my place. I forgot that I was a pet-\" \n\"I'm sorry. I'm really-\" \n\"You shouldn't tell me sorry Master,\" \n\"Don't call me Master\". He growled. \nI looked away. \n\"Brittany, look at me\". He said. \nOut of fear, I slowly look up at him. Even when sitting, he was obviously taller than me. \n\"I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't have said all those things. Please stop acting like this around me. I want the real Brittany back\". \nI smirked at what he said. \nHe didn't know me. He didn't know the real Brittany. \nThe real Brittany was a confident girl that didn't give a damn about what people think about her. \nAll that changed the moment my dad decided to remarry when I was ten. \nI was like my mom... At least that was what my dad told me. \n\"The real Brittany?\" I snickered. \"You don't know the real Brittany. She's been gone for a long time and I don't think she's ever going to come back\". \nHe looked confused but I wasn't going to explain further. \n\"What do you mean?\" He asked, furrowing his eyebrows. \nI wasn't going to reply so I ignored him. \nHe sighed. \nFor some reason, that sigh made me feel kind of guilty. \n\"Master, please don't apologize to me. I'm not angry, I'm just acting as a pet should\". I said in my sweetest voice. \n\"Stop being so difficult. I'm trying to make amends. I'm truly sorry Britt,\". \nI couldn't pretend anymore. I let my emotions out. \n\"Do you know how it hurts to be reminded that you're nothing but a pet? A pet with no value whatsoever? Do you know how it hurts to-\" I was interrupted by my sobs. \nI let the tears that I'd been holding in for long fall. \nIt hurt like hell. It hurts to know that your life changed from something to nothing. It hurts to be reminded about that just when you begin to think you are better than nothing - \nCole cupped my face in his large hands. \nI let all the tears fall. I've been trying so hard to keep them in for weeks... \n\"I'm really sorry Britt, really sorry\". He said. \nWiping my tears with his thumb, he stared deep into my eyes like he could read me inside out, his blue eyes burning into my soul. \n\"I'm not angry with you Cole, really. I'm just upset with my life\". I said convincingly, maintaining eye contact with him. \nFor an unknown reason, my eyes travelled down to his lips. When I realized that dirty thoughts were forming in my head, my face heated up. \nCole gave a knowing smirk but then the atmosphere got tense again. \nAs if he had read my mind, Cole pressed his lips on mine, closing the gap between us. \nI froze. \nHe wrapped his arms around my waist and neck, pulling me closer to him to deepen the kiss. I didn't hesitate as I kissed him back, even though I was a little bit inexperienced. \nHe ran his tongue on my bottom lip, asking for entrance which I didn't deny him of for some weird reason. \nThe kiss was slow and delicate. \nGetting caught in the moment, my hand found it's way to the back of his head and tugged on his hair gently. \nAfter some minutes, I pulled away breathlessly. \nAll these days, I was in a stage of self denial, not wanting to admit to myself that I had feelings for Cole, my master, because it was unheard of. \nThe kiss we shared just surfaced the feelings and the feeling was stronger. \nI was supposed to feel regret after the kiss, but the feelings I denied came back stronger instead. \nCole, on the other hand, seemed to regret it. He didn't even make an effort in hiding the regret that was so evident in his expression. \nMaybe I shouldn't feel for him. \nI thought. \n\"I'm sorry\". He said one last time before leaving the room. \nI wanted to call him back and yell that I had forgiven him. I wanted him to kiss me again without regretting it but he was gone before I knew it. \nAfter some minutes, I went into the closet and picked out my PJs. \nI knew that Cole wasn't going to come back so I changed my clothes in the room before crawling into Cole's bed. \nI wasn't going to sleep, I wanted to think about my life. \n*** \nCole's POV \nI shouldn't have kissed her. \nThe kiss brought a feeling... An abominable one. \nI just couldn't stay away from her. I wanted to be where she was. Seeing her happy also made happy. Seeing her sad made me feel guilty, especially if the person that made her sad was me. \nI was falling for Brittany. \nBut I couldn't be with her no matter how badly I wanted to. So the only solution to this was to get rid of the foreign feelings. \nI walked into my office and sprung on the couch after locking the door behind me. \nI'd been staying there for more than a week now so I could as well call this place my second room. \nI'm so sorry Britt, but falling for you will do us no good. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people \ud83d\ude0a \nThey finally passed the stage of self denial \ud83d\ude00 \nWhat about the kiss? \nI know I suck at kiss scenes, it's not my fault though. I hope you enjoyed this chapter even if it kinda sucks. \nSo... How about we start shipping their names *smirk \n** \nPlease Vote, Comment and Share. \nLove y'all\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc96 \n\nThis comment may be offensive. \n\n"

Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nCole's POV \n'I'll forget about the kiss and just approach her normally' . I thought. \nIt's been five days since the kiss and I haven't talked to Brittany. \nI had to talk to her because we'll be going to see my father in two days and she had to put on the best behavior as a pet. \nI stared at the pile of clothes on the couch in my office. \nShe had to pick one out of them. The clothes were probably going to be too small and tight for her but I couldn't let dad know I cared for her. He would just find ways to take her away. \nShe had five choices of clothing to choose from. All the clothes showed little or no dignity whatsoever, but one was better than the other. \nI felt really bad that she had to wear one of these clothes. \nI picked up the clothes and walked to my room. \n*** \nBrittany's POV \nI stared at the clothes that Cole brought for me. I had to choose one of these shabby looking clothes. \nI almost forgot about our upcoming visit to Cole's dad. \nI looked at the clothes one last time before choosing a red dress that reached just under my butts with two tiny straps. That was the only dress that had little modesty in it. The rest of the clothes were mostly see-through. \nI chose a plain black collar with red rose designs on it to go with my red dress. \nI felt like a complete whore wearing the dress. \nCole didn't look happy about it either but there was lust in his eyes when he looked at me in my tiny dress. \nI mean, it's not his fault. \nHe gave me an accessory to wear on my ankle. \n\"Thank you\". I said. \nHe nodded. \n\"Now you have to learn the rules\". He said. \n\"You shouldn't talk to anyone even if they're talking about you. You should only speak when you are asked a question\". He said. \nI nodded. \n\"Also, always look down. Don't look up except you are told to\". He said. \n\"When my dad asks you questions, keep your tone as soft as possible 'cause he'll ask some questions to get a reaction out of you. No matter how annoying his questions may be, you have to show him respect or you don't know what your punishment may be\". \nHe continued to tell me the do's and dont's for like thirty minutes before walking to the couch. \nI walked to the window, staring at the bright blue sky and letting the awkward silence consume me. \nThe feel of his hand on my skin made me jerk back to reality. \n\"We need to talk\". He said. \n\"You've told me all I need to know and I understand everything perfectly, master\". I said, bowing my head in respect. \n\"Not about that, it's about what happened some days ago\". \nOh, that's right, the kiss. \nI nodded slowly. \n\"I know everything got awkward after the kiss. I don't like the awkwardness between us, I can't stand it anymore. Let's just act like it never happened. Can you do that?\" \nThat was all I'd been trying to do for the past few days. Forget about the kiss and act like nothing happened. But a kiss like that was hard to forget, not when the thought of our lips moving in sync kept creeping into my mind. \nI nodded slowly. \n\"You sure?\". He asked. His intimidating blue eyes staring directly into mine. \nNo! \nI wanted to scream, but I found myself nodding instead. But deep within, I knew I wasn't going to be able to act like nothing happened. My cheeks were going keep heating up everytime I thought of it but I assured him anyways. \n\"Good. So what do you say we go downstairs to have dinner today?\" He asked with a huge smile spread across his face. \nSounds amazing. I thought sarcastically. I hated going to the dining room to have dinner. \nI was getting bored of staying in the room all day so my traitorous subconscious made me say \"Okay\". \n'You love referring to me like you'd refer to a normal human, don't you?' My subconscious said sarcastically. \n'Let's just say you've grown on me. Now shut the hell up'. I replied inside my head. \nHe smiled. \n\"I'm gonna take you somewhere after we come back from my dad's place. So get ready\". \nOkay, that got me curious. \n\"Wait, a minute, I got something for you. It'll make your life a little less boring\". He said. \nI knew my life was a boring mess but you couldn't really blame me for that, right? \nHe brought out a novel and a medium sized note and handed it over to me. \n\"Ehmm, I'll buy new novels for you when you're done with the old ones. You can use the note to jot down new words or something. Whatever you wanna use it for\". He said before checking his wristwatch. \"Sorry, gotta go. I have some documents to attend to\". He said and left. \nI loved reading novels and I could use the note as a songbook. \nFinally. A book to replace the songbook I had back at home. \nPerfect. \n*** A/N: Hey guys\ud83d\ude0a \nI'm sorry for the late update. \nPardon my errors, I'm not thinking straight right now...

Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nHey guys! \nThis chapter's really short\ud83d\ude05 \nI apologize for that. \nYou may proceed... \n*** I picked on my nails nervously as I stared at myself in the mirror while Cole was also getting ready. \nI was staring at myself in the mirror. I couldn't stop thinking about what Cole told me. How dangerous was his father? \nI had to be ready for the worst. \n\"You ready?\" Cole asked. \nI nodded slowly. \nHe attached the leash to my collar and led me out of the room. \n* \nI had not been out of the house for weeks. \nIt felt so good to feel natural air. \nI almost felt like I was free again... But reality was, I wasn't. \nWe got into a black limo. \nBefore my dad sold me, I didn't really fancy limos. I always thought limos occupied too much space all. \nAll that changed when I entered the black limo. The interior was white. The seats were covered with expensive white leather. Everything looked exquisite. \nThe last time I'd been in a limo wasn't so pleasant so I didn't pay attention to the details. \nSoon, the journey to Cole's dad's home begun. \nI fell asleep after a few hours. \n*** \nSomeone tugged on my leash gently. I groaned as I rubbed my eyes. \nI looked up at the person tugging on my leash. Of course, Cole. \nHe looked pissed off. He must have tried waking me up several times. \nI stepped out of the limo and adjusted my short dress. \nBefore me stood a magnificent house. It was bigger than Cole's house and it had a castle like structure. \nCole cleared his throat. I realized that my mouth was open. I quickly closed my mouth. \n'Remember everything I taught you' \nCole's voice rang in my head, making me jump a little. \nI'd never get used to that. \nI nodded. \nWe started walking towards the entrance of the castle-like house. I was dreading the fact that I was actually going to see the pureblood vampire king. \nCole tugged on my leash harshly. \nI realized that my pace was slow so I increased my pace. \nWe got into the house or castle. \nWhatever it was called. \nAnd then a big door that led to a large room opened. \nMy jaw dropped once more but I quickly closed my mouth back \n\"You're here \". A female voice cooed. \nI heard Cole snort. \nA pretty young woman appeared beside Cole and wrapped her arms around his arms \n\"I really missed you\". She said, cooing into the already pissed off Cole's ear. \n\"Nicholas\". A cold voice said, sending a chill down my spine. \nCole froze for a second. \nSo his full name is Nicholas. \nA man with golden eyes appeared. \nHis eyes were so beautiful, yet scary. \nHe screamed so much venom and authority, this scared me a lot. \nHe must be Cole's father. \nCole's eyes were stone cold. \nHe stiffly bowed. \nHis dad smirked then his eyes shifted to me. \n\"You never told me you had a new pet, son. I had to find out myself\". He said. \n\"We're here now so what do you want?\" Cole asked, rather rudely. \n\"I called you here to talk about your coming of age ceremony and I also want you to meet someone, I'm sure you'd be glad to meet\". \nWhat in the world is a coming of age ceremony?!?!?!? \n\"We've done that already\". \n\"But we didn't speak about your pet's involvement\". \n\"I don't want to involve her\". Cole said sternly. \n\"We both know that you have to. That's why you got a pet in the first place,right?\" \n\"I bought her because I needed a companion and not for a stupid coming of age ceremony!\" \nThis coming of age ceremony sounds pretty serious, considering the fact that I should be involved and Cole didn't seem really pleased with it. \n\"Watch your tongue son. You could always get another one. Or is there another reason why you're so keen on keeping her?\" He asked suspiciously. \n\"You don't expect me to drain a pet which cost a whole fortune do you?\" \n\"So it's a special pet, huh?\" \n\"I don't know what you're trying to get at but trust me, you won't get answers by playing these stupid mind games. I don't need to explain myself to you\". \nCole said, trying to contain his anger. He walked away tugging on my leash harshly. \nWhatever this was about, I knew it wasn't going to be good. Since it involved getting my blood drained and it seemed to aggravate Cole. \nI'd gotten myself into a big mess. Maybe I should have escaped when I had the chance to. Now I couldn't escape. I had to face it. \n* A/N: Hey beautiful people\ud83d\ude0a \nI'm sorry for the short chapter and the late update as well. \nSchool's been taking my time. \nSubconscious: Yeah yeah, that's always your excuse. \nMe: (ignores subconscious) Thanks for understanding. \nDon't forget to vote, comment and share. \nLove y'all\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\ude18 \n\n\n"

I'm getting crazy... Focus Cole, focus. \n\"Not now... Maybe tomorrow. Let's talk about your coming off age ceremony... You have one more week till your coming off age ceremony... You finally have a snack to feed on, during your transformation, you're gonna wake up and feed on her till you're satisfied. She can survive, depending on her blood type... If it's a really good one, you might drain her completely. After feeding on her, you'll both pass out. And then your transformation process will be completed\". \n\"You may not be able to control yourself while drinking from her... Or during the transformation process... You'll be in your full vampiric form... He continued. \nThat'll be a real problem cause I don't wanna lose Brittany... \nShe's my third pet but she's special... \nNo matter what, I'll try to control myself... \n\"You should be a lecturer in the next generation then you'll be an actor after that\". I said. \"Out there, you were acting all cool and fierce and then you're acting like you wouldn't hurt the tiniest insect in here\". \nHe smirked. I wish I could wipe that stupid smirk off his face. \n\"A Vampire king's gotta be like that sometimes\". He said. \"Let's meet here by 1:00pm here tomorrow\". \nI nodded and left. \n* I have to hurt Brittany for a stupid coming off age ceremony? Who does dad want me to meet? What's he up to? \nI thought. \nThese thoughts were driving me crazy. \nI opened the door to my room. The light was switched on but there was an innocent looking Brittany sleeping on the floor... \nI'm sorry it has to be like this for a couple of days Britt... I'll make it up to you when we get back home. \nI placed a blanket over her and went to get undressed before occupying myself with some documents. \n'We don't have enough blood in the store... We have to get supplies from the hospital next week'. \nI thought. \n* \nBrittany's POV \nI yawned as I tossed away the blanket that Cole must have put over me. \nMy back and butt ached from sleeping on the hard floor. I'm kinda used to Cole's soft bed. \nCole wasn't in the room. He must have gone for a meeting or something \nI went into the bathroom to wash my face and hands. I won't be having my bath for a couple of days. \nCole said I could wear only two sets of clothes so I didn't change my clothes since my other pair was just a large shirt that reached my mid thigh. \nMy collar was still on my neck so I just had to wait for master to come back for me. \nI was told not to open the window so I just walked round the room aimlessly. \nWas I not supposed to have my own room so people wouldn't think there's a vampire pet relationship between us? \nThe door flung open. \nCole came in looking really upset. \nHe walked into the bathroom and came back out with his bathrobe on. \nHe walked into the large closet and came back out with a different pair of jean pants and a grey T- shirt on. \nI continued to stare at him till he called me. \n\"Pet\". He said in a low venomous voice. \nI quickly scrambled to him with my head bowed. \n\"Yes master\". I said. \nHe looked at me for some seconds before doing the unexpected. \nHe pulled me closer to him and wrapped his arms around my waist. \nI carefully observed him for a few seconds. His eyes were turning black and veins were growing on his face. \nFear gripped me immediately. \nHe pressed his lips forcefully on mine and forced his way into my mouth. He pressed harsh kisses on my neck and then I felt his arms tighten around my waist. I felt his cold tongue on my bare neck as his grip on my waist tightened. \nHe looked at me, raising up my wrist. \nHis fangs had grown. This gave him a really scary vibe. \n\"Pet, your scent is so heavenly you know,\" He said and kissed my wrist. \nAnd then I felt a sudden sharp pain on my wrist. \nI leaned against Cole as he continued drinking from me, moans of pleasure escaping his lips. \nI wrapped my arms around his neck to give myself support. \nBlack spots started filling my vision. Everything became gradually quiet till the only thing I could hear was my heartbeat and the sound of Cole gulping my blood. \nI eventually blacked out after the sound of my own gasp. \n* A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nHow was that huh? \nI know I sucked at the scene but that was all I could come up with. \nHalloween's coming soon! Who's excited? \nIs there anyone who's gonna dress up as a vampire?!? \nUnfortunately, my country doesn't celebrate Halloween:( \nBut I enjoy the thrill of seeing people's Halloween costumes online:) \nSoooo.... I guess that's all for this chapter? \nI'm not gonna be updating for like six weeks but I promise I'm gonna do that during the holidays. \nDon't forget to vote and comment. \nLove y'all\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\ude18 \n\n\n"

Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \n* Cole's POV \nOnce it was 12:50pm, I put on a Black T-shirt and a pair of black jean pants and set out to dad's office. \nHe was wearing a BlueT-shirt and Jean pants. \nIt's nice to know that he hasn't forgotten his casual clothes. \n\"Ready?\" He asked. \nI nodded. \n* The large black door opened and we walked in... \nThe dungeon?!? \n\"What are we doing in the castle's dungeon?\" I asked. \n\"You'll see yourself\". \nWe walked down till we got to the end of hallway with only one room with a door instead of bars. \nDad took a key out of his pocket and unlocked the door. \nThere was a lady with rough hair curled up in a ball by the corner of the room. \n\"We're here\". Dad announced. \nShe turned to look at us. \nWe both gasped in shock. \nRhea!!! \n\"Rhea\". I said in low voice. \n\"Cole\". She said in a weak voice. \nDad just stood there... \n\"I thought you were dead\". I said. \nMy anger towards dad was gradually building up. \n\"I wasn't supposed to let you see her until after your coming off age ceremony but-\". Dad said. \n\"But what? You kept my twin away from me for more than a hundred freaking years and you're acting all cool about it?!?\" I yelled. \n\"Calm down\". He said. \n\"Don't tell me to calm down when you know that it won't help!\" I yelled. \n\"Well, since you aren't ready to listen, I just wanted you to know that she's still alive cause I didn't want you causing any drama during the ceremony...\" He yelled back. \n\"I'll explain to you after your coming of age ceremony.... By then you'll act more mature instead of throwing a fit\". He spat. \nI lifted my fist to hit him but I was stopped by a guard so I decided to let it out on the guard instead. \nHis cry of agony was music to my ears. It urged me to beat him more. \nI've never transformed to my full vampire form but I can still grow fangs and I can still go wild and dark. \nRhea's scream stopped me immediately. \nShe looked so scared... \nI can't believe I did this after seeing my twin after so many years. \nI'm sorry Rhea... I'm really sorry. \nI glanced at my dad.. He hasn't changed one bit. He was just faking everything. \nI stormed out of the dungeon angrily. \n***** I ignored my pet's questioning look and walked into the bathroom. \nI thought having a cold shower will help me calm down, turns out I was wrong. \nFrustrated, I put on my bathrobe and went into the closet to pick out a pair of jean pants and a grey shirt. \nThen I realized that my pet had been staring at me. \nA dangerous craving started growing in me. \nI did all I could to suppress it but I couldn't. I became sensitive to her scent and all. \n\"Pet\". I called out. I noticed the change in my voice too. \nShe quickly walked up to me, bowing. \n\"Yes master\". She said. \nHer innocent voice made me crave her even more. \nI obeyed my instincts and pulled her close to me. I felt her stiffen but that made me crave for her more than I ever did. \nI wrapped my arms around her waist as I began to feel dangerous. \nI could feel my fangs growing once again. \nI pressed my lips on hers, savouring the taste of her lips. \nFuck! Her lips were softer than I could ever imagine! \nI pressed kisses on her neck and ran my tongue through it. \nMy fangs grew completely but I just couldn't bite her neck. My grip on her waist tightened as I took her wrist. \nHer scent became stronger. \n\"Pet, your scent is so heavenly you know,\" I said. \nI slowly sank my fangs into her wrist. \nI became wild as soon as the taste of her blood hit my tongue. \nI moaned in pleasure as I continued drinking from her. \nShe wrapped her hands around my neck. \nShe leaned on me completely as I continued drinking from her, moans of pleasure escaping my lips every passing second. \nThen I heard her gasp. \nHer gasp brought me back to reality. \nWhat have I done?!?!? \nI thought as I stared at Britt's unconscious body. \nI should have been more careful. \nI lifted her up bridal style and put her on the bed. \nLooking at her filled me with guilt. \nShe has seen me, the real me, a monster. \nI went out to get some 'O' positive blood after making sure I locked the door. \nAfter getting blood from the hospital, I went back to my room. \nAnd passed some blood into her veins. \nShe remained unconscious for the whole night. \nI'm sorry Britt... I'm really sorry. \nI've offended two people that are so dear to me today.... I hope they forgive me. \n'Don't forget she's your pet and not so dear to you'. My subconscious said. \nI growled at the annoying voice in my head. \nTo be honest, I've always heard this voice in my head but I've always ignored it. I decided to reply today. \n'She cost a whole fortune'. I growled. \n'You can't deceive me... You know that I'm you and you're me right? So I can feel whatever your feeling and-' \n'Shut up'. I growled. \nI think it's better if I just ignore this almost inaudible but greatly annoying voice. \n'You think I'm annoying because I'm speaking the truth?' The voice called a subconscious said. \nI just ignored it. \nSooooo annoying! Is a vampire supposed to have a subconscious too?!? \nIt'll definitely go away after my coming off age ceremony. \n'You wish'. Said the annoying subconscious. 'Take care of your little dear pet' \nIt teased me. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nSoooo... Cole has a twin huh? \nWhat do you think about that? \nHe finally drank from her. The coming off age ceremony is getting really close. \nHappy Halloween to y'all!!\ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\udc7b \nHave a spooktacular Halloween and don't forget to vote and comment. \nLove y'all\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude18 \n\n\n"

Guys, MVL ranked #1 in #vampireslave ... It couldn't have been possible without you.. Thanks a lot guys! I love you! \nBrittany's POV \n*** It took an effort to stand up to brush my hair. \nI felt like I did a hundred push ups yesterday night. Memories from yesterday where blurred and there was a burning pain in my wrist. \nI looked at the scar on my wrist and hissed at the pain that I got from touching it. \nThe pieces of memories from yesterday started coming together. \nI thought really hard as I brushed my hair a little bit harshly because it had too many knots in it. \nI let out a sudden gasp. \nCole. \nHe bit me yesterday... He actually drank my blood till I passed out. \nI know he should have done this a long time ago but he should have Informed me before doing such a cruel thing to me. \nI don't know why I feel so sad about this but it was too sudden... \nI felt a tear drop run down my face. \nI shouldn't cry, it could have been sooner or later anyways. \nI kept saying to myself... \nI'm the pet and he's the master... It cost a fortune to buy me so why wouldn't he drink from me? \nYeah, I know I'm the stupid Britt who only realizes the truth when she's sad but I don't care. I acknowledged the truth and that's all that's all that matters to me... Or maybe not..... \n\"Britt, can we talk?\" Cole's voice brought me back to life.... Actually, his voice jerked me back to life cause standing here talking to him here's as scary as shit. \n\"C- Master...\". I stuttered, bowing my head. \n\"Can we talk?\" \nOf course not, the thought of talking to you brings me so close to peeing on myself. \nMy body said another thing entirely as I found myself nodding. \nHe motioned to the sofa. \nI sat down there just like an obedient dog should. \nI just noticed that I didn't have my collar on... Panic set in. \nWhat if he gets tempted to drink from me again?!? \nI tapped my fingers nervously on my bare thighs as I tried to push away all the negative thoughts. \nI couldn't look at him in the eyes but an imagination popped up when I took a glance at him. \nI imagined the veins along with more scary features on his face. I mentally screamed till the clearing of his throat  brought me back to reality. \nHere goes the long talk. \n\"Umm... Morning\". He said. \nWell, this was awkward. \n\"Morning m- master\". I managed to reply. \n\"Yesterday,\"  He begun... \"I know I fucked up but I'm really sorry... I still can't believe that I could do that because I didn't plan to drink from you, some certain events drove me to do it. I saw someone that I never thought I'd see... Someone that I thought never existed again, some-\" He sighed. \n\"I know I'm talking too much but please forgive me... You can call me names, I deserve any name you call me, I'm really sorry\". \nHe looked so vulnerable that I almost believed him but the other part of me wanted to show him who Britt really was but a second thought stopped my actions. \n\"There's no need for that master\". I said. \n\"Please don't call me master. I didn't mean to do what I did, I was angry...\" He explained. \nI understand him. I really do I'm just scared that he might get angry and suck my blood again. I know he didn't mean to do it on purpose. I'm not even angry with him. \n\"The truth is, I'm not angry... I'm just hurt\". I said, opening up to him. \"I know this should have happened sooner or later but it was all too sudden\". \nI don't know where the confidence came from but I finally gathered up courage to look at him in the eyes but when I did, I realized that his physical features changed a little bit. \nHis eyes were a deeper shade of blue and he looked paler and hotter than before, even his lips were a lot rosier. \nI guess that's what drinking direct from source can do to a vampire. \nTill then I didn't realize that he was wearing a tight fitting shirt which showed off his abs and well defined eight packs. His skin could have being perfectly tanned but he's a vampire... No matter what he does, his skin will always be pale. \nI quickly shifted my gaze before he discovered that I was actually checking him out but guess what, he caught  me already. \nHe smirked. \n\"Checking me out huh?\" He asked. \nI blushed. \n\"I- um... I was um...\" I couldn't even form a proper sentence. \n\"You were what?\" He said. \n\"I was observing you\". I said. \nSeriously?!? That was all I could come up with? \n\"I see -\" Cole said. \nThis was the Cole I knew, the real Cole. The playful, cocky Cole. \n\"Observing me.... Am I like some type of experiment that needs to be observed?\" He asked. \n\"Maybe\". \n\"So... Do you forgive me?\" He asked with pleading eyes. \nI nodded. \nHis face broke into a huge smile as he engulfed me in a hug before he could even realize it. \nIt took some minutes before he realized that he was actually hugging me. \nHe broke the hug and apologized. \n\"It's okay\". \nI actually liked it. \n'Whatever this is, stop it Brittany' \nMy subconscious told me. \n'You can't stop feelings you know,\" \nI replied. \n'Feelings? You mean falling for your vampire master?' \n'Whatever'. \nI have conversations with myself sometimes. \n\"I have something to show you but that will be when we leave this annoying place\". Cole suddenly said. \n\"Great! What do you wanna show me?\" I asked eagerly. \n\"It's a surprise\". He said. \nI scoffed. \n\"A surprise huh?\" \nHe hummed a response. \nI snorted unladylike. \n\"Can't you just give me a hint?\" I pleaded. \n\"Nuh - uh\". \nI'm not a fan of surprises... Surprises are like cliffhangers... You just have to wait to see what happens. \nCole's phone beeped. \nHe read the text and frowned immediately. \nI thought I heard him growl. \n\"Ummm... I have to go\". He said and left before I even had the chance to reply. \nI didn't even get to ask him about the person he saw... The person he never thought he would see again. \nWell, I can ask him later. \nMy mind's at ease now that we've gotten everything resolved. \nIt's a pity that I can't look outside the window to see what another vampire city looked like. \nI sat on my blanket and looked at the scar on my hand one more time. \nIf only I could watch TV right now then my life wouldn't be the same as it is right now. \nUh huh!!! \nCole has a TV in his so called office! Once we get back home, I'll go there every single day. \nI spent the rest of my day in my own world... \nMy wrist hurt a bit and I still felt like I did a hundred pushups but c'mon we all know that I can't even do five. \n*** \nA/N: That was a bad way to end the chapter huh? \nI'm sooo sorry. I encountered a terrible writer's block while writing this chapter. \nI didn't particularly get rid of it but I managed to post this chapter. \nI'm finally done with my exams but I still have a party at school to deal with so the excitement is still there which may lead to a not-so-terrible writer's block. \nI can write at school when I have the chance to ... \nNote: Only when I have the chance to (I may and may not) \nI'm gonna be posting an announcement after this chapter. \nDon't forget to vote and comment. \nI wanna say a big thank you to all those who added my story to their reading lists, those who voted on my story, the commentators (even though you're very few) and those who gave my story a chance by reading it. I appreciate it a lot. \nI was practically jumping when I saw that some people added my story to their reading lists... It really made my day. Thanks a lot. \nLove y'all\u2764\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc96 \n\n\n"

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nCole's POV \n*** I walked to dad's office hurriedly, I was still furious about what happened two days ago. \nI have some rites to perform with Rhea before the ceremony. \nI was happy Brittany wasn't mad at me anymore but dad had to interrupt us. \nTalking to her made me feel so relaxed. \nI pushed the thoughts of Brittany aside when I got to the sacred place for twin rites. \nWe did tons of things during the rites. We had to pierce our skins for droplets of blood needed for the ritual. \nDid I forget to mention that Rhea looked so different than the last time? \nHer hair was looking so much better than the rough mess on her head the last time I saw her. She was wearing a black dress with shiny studs around it. Her Pearl necklace matched so well with her dress. She was obviously putting on a lot of make-up. She put on a silver stiletto and her signature sweet smile made everything perfect. \nOur bloods were required for the ceremony before transformation. \nAfter the rites, I stayed back, waiting for dad to speak with whoever he was speaking with. \nHe texted me saying there was something I had to see. \nI was still really angry with him for keeping Rhea from me for years. \nWhen he was done, he walked over to me and said \n\"Son, you've just completed the first step of your ceremony\". \n\"That's pretty obvious\". I said, rolling my eyes. \n\"Let's go\". He said but I held him back. \n\"I hope it's not something that will make me angry because I wouldn't spare you this time\". I said, with threat in my voice. \nHe shrugged. \n\"We both know you can't do anything to me even if I get you angry\". He said. \nI growled. \nHe patted my back. \n*** \nWe went into the castle's library and closed the door behind us. \nHe pulled out a box and brought out the prettiest pearl necklace I had seen in my almost two hundred years of living. \nI almost gasped at the beauty but I remembered that I wasn't here to marvel at pretty things. \n\"What does a pearl necklace have to do with anything?\" I asked \n\"This is your mother's necklace. She always wanted to give it to her daughter in-law before she-\" He said, sniffing like he was actually crying. \nI wouldn't fall for it because she didn't die because it was her time to, he refused to make her immortal when she needed it the most, he let her die and now he's acting like he was devastated about her death. \nHe even threw a birthday party for one of his closest friends some days after my mom's death. I'm not exaggerating this but I can say he was the drunkest vampire at the party. \nThat's one of the many reasons why I decided to get my own castle and my own followers. I couldn't bear to live with someone like that. He was nothing but a cold hearted animal. \n\"Don't act like you care\". I snorted. \"We all know what you did a few days after mom's death\". I said, referring to the party. \n\"I told you to stop talking about that\". He growled. \"I only did that to push the memories of her away. I can't remain sad for the rest of my life, can I?\" \n\"You call just a few days the rest of your life? You're pointless. You're not making any sense. You acted like you loved her and you wanted to push all memories of her in a few days? You're unbelievable!\" I yelled in anger. \nI didn't want this, Rhea didn't want this either. It just happened. \n\"I can see you aren't ready to discuss the main reason why we're here\". He said, obviously trying to contain his anger. \n\"You can show me some other time, I'm not in the mood for all this\". I said and left the library. \n*** I walked back to the room I didn't want to get angry. I didn't want dad to get me angry again. He likes it when I get angry because that's when I do dangerous things- Like drinking from Brittany which I never intended to do till my coming off age ceremony. \nSpeaking of Brittany, she was lying gracefully in the little space she had all to herself apart from the bathroom which she couldn't even use efficiently because we had to be very careful. A small gesture could arouse suspicion. \nI lay on the king sized bed left with my own thoughts. I couldn't  fall asleep for three reasons. \nFirstly, my pet was sleeping on the floor with a small blankie around her. Sleeping on the hard floor is definitely not comfortable. \nSecondly, I was trying to put all the pieces together to try and find out dad's reason for calling me to the library. I didn't want another meeting with him but I was curious. \nThirdly, my coming of age ceremony. I didn't want to drink from Brittany. I knew I wouldn't be myself during the transformation and I may suck her dry. \nI tossed from one end of the bed to another. I didn't want my mortal body to transform. That would definitely lead to a change in behavior, it's not like there was some sort of prevention for it. \nThe thoughts roaming in my head didn't let me sleep so I watched Brittany. She looked so peaceful. \nThis will surely keep me busy till dawn. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nI'm really sorry for the late update. I had a terrible writer's block... I still have it but I managed to write this chapter. \nI'm also sorry that it's short. \nI'll try to make the next chapter longer. \nShoutout To: \ni_feoluwaa for her contribution to MVL.

Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nDedicated to PurpleDove321 \nCole's POV \n*** \n\"Brittany, wake up\". I said in a low whisper, shaking Brittany in an attempt to wake her up. \nShe groaned and almost used her right leg to hit my stomach but I artfully dodged it. \nSo... She doesn't like being woken up from sleep huh? \nI wasn't feeling exactly happy today, if anything, I was feeling thousands of negative emotions flow through me. \nYup, that's right, it's finally time for my coming of age ceremony. \nActually, we've performed several rites  and now it was time for the transformation. \n\"Wake up please... I need to talk to you\". I whispered. \nAfter several attempts along with a kick which I couldn't dodge, she finally woke up. \n\"M-master-\" She said. \nHer eyes widened a little bit. \nI guess she realized that she kicked me. \n\"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to, I-\" She apologized. \n\"It's okay, it didn't even hurt\". I said. \nActually it did hurt but not really.. Things like this wouldn't hurt a bit when I go through the transformation process. \nHa, I almost forgot. \n\"Ummm, I want to talk to you immediately\". I said. \nShe nodded. \n\"It's the day of my coming off age ceremony and-\" \n\"What in fuck's name is a coming off age ceremony?!?\" She cut me short. \n\"Mind your language Britt. The importance of the ceremony is to convert a mortal body to an immortal one. There are series of rites you need to perform before the transformation process\". I explained. \n\"Does it also involve draining my blood\". She asked. \nI tensed up. How did she know? \n\"You mentioned something about draining me the day we arrived remember?\" She said. \nIf I wasn't so tensed up right now,  I'd have asked her if she had secret mind reading powers. \n\"Ummm, yeah, I want to talk to you about that\". I said. \nShe nodded. \n\"I've reached the transformation process and I'll soon be put to sleep. Halfway through the transformation, I'll be woken up to ummm- drink from you. I won't be my normal self when I'm awoken. I'll be brutal and rough but I'll try to resist drinking too much\". I explained. \nHer body was already tense and I can't really blame her. \n\"Trust me, if there was another option, I'd have gone for it instead of drinking from you but there's no other option than to drink from you\". I explained. \nShe nodded. \n\"I understand perfectly\". She said. \n\"Umm.... You can change into the oversized T-shirt. It's considerably longer than the dress\". I said, my eyes raking through her clothes. \nIt's taking everything in me to keep my hands to myself. Just a little stretch and her butts will be on full show. \nShe nodded and walked into the bathroom with the shirt in her hands. \nThe shirt was actually mine but it was oversize for me too. \nAfter a minute, Brittany came back out with her dress in her hands. The shirt was reaching her knees, below her knees actually. Her petite figure squirming under the intensity of my gaze. \nI averted my gaze from her. I put her collar around her neck and led her outside. \nThe collar will be removed anyway so it's pointless. \nWe got to the entrance of the sacred hall where I had to depart from Britt. \n*** Brittany's POV \nI watched Cole disappear through the door. A man of average height approached me. His nose seemed a little bit crooked. He looked like he was in his mid fifties. Definitely not a vampire. \nHe smiled at me and gave a small bow. \n\"Good day ma'am. I'm Demus\". He said in an accent that I couldn't decipher. \n\"Good day Mr Demus\". I said. \n\"I've been sent here to instruct you\". He said. \"Prince Cole is being put to sleep now. He'll be awoken in five hours, that's halfway through his transformation. As his pet, you are to sit beside the table he's been placed on till he awakens. You shouldn't make a sound once he's been awoken or he may take more blood than necessary. He'll take as much blood as he pleases and that's what determines if you'll survive it or not. No matter what just stay strong\". \nI nodded. Trying to be as calm as possible. This is a life-death situation. Whether I'll survive it or not depends on how much blood he takes from me. \nDemus led me into the room. \nCole's body was on a table made of glass. He looked so lifeless. \nBeside him was a lady. Her face wasn't visible to me but she had the same hair colour with Cole. \nI sat down quietly beside him, awaiting my doom. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nY'all should keep your fingers crossed. Our dear Brittany's life is at stake. \nDon't be so sure, she might not survive it. \nWell, let's wait till next chapter. The outcome of the next chapter depends on my mood. \nDon't forget to vote and comment. \nLove y'all\ud83d\ude18\u2764\ud83d\ude18 \n\n\n"

Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nAfter what seemed like forever, Cole's eyes flung open. \nHis eyes found mine. \nIt was completely black! And it scared the shit out of me! I know I've seen his eyes turning black and all that but not completely black! \nHe slowly sat up in a way that made me want to run for my dear life but my body had different plans. I stayed completely rooted on my seat as I said my last prayers. \nThe girl beside him woke up too. Her eyes were the same color with his. Black! \nUnlike Cole, she wasted no time in standing up. She walked slowly towards me, baring her fangs at me. \nOh my gosh, are they both gonna drink from me?!? \nI'm going to die at such a young age!!! \nI'm not gonna survive this. I know it. I can feel it. \nWith slow and steady steps, she walked over to me. \nCole finally stood up too. \nYou're gonna die Britt, you're gonna die a painful death! My subconscious said and I actually agreed with it. \nI closed my eyes, waiting for the feel of a pair of fangs on my neck or wrist or anywhere. \nOne second passed. \nTwo seconds... \nThree... \nFour... \nFive... \n... \nNothing happened. \nI slowly opened my eyes. \nI was more than relieved when I realized that she wasn't walking towards me. \nShe was walking towards something behind me. \nSomeone actually. \nA nerdy looking guy with freckles scattered by the side of his nose looking like he'd pee on himself any minute was standing behind me. \nHe looked as scared as shit. \nDo you even know how you look right now? \nFor the second time today, I agreed with my subconscious. \nShe closed up the little gap that was between them and sunk her fangs into his neck. \nThere was a light gasp. It was light but it sounded really painful. \nI watched in horror as she gulped down his blood. Low growls of satisfaction erupting from her throat. \nI thought I saw blood trickle down her mouth... I'm not entirely sure. \nHis knees weakened as she took more blood from him. She roughly shoved him against the wall. \nI saw a tear drop from the corner of his eyes as he gasped for breath. \nYour blood will be taken like that soon. \nFor a minute, I forgot that I was going too face the same horrible fate. \nI realized that I actually gasped too. \nI clamped my hands against my mouth. \nDo you have to be so stupid?!? My stupid subconscious said. \n'You should be saying your last prayers too 'cause I'm not going to be dying alone\". I pointed out to my subconscious. \nCole was still trying to resist it. He was fighting off the urge. He looked like he was- in pain. \nYou really shouldn't do this. Just drink from me. \nStupidly, I repeat, stupidly, I stood up and took a daring step towards Cole. \n\"Don't!\" \nHis voice sounded so cold, so deadly, so distant. \n\"Stop hurting yourself. Just drink from me\". I said. \nSeriously Britt?!? Seriously?!? \n\"No! I don't want to! Now sit on the fucking chair!\" His cold voice ordered. \nBut you know what? I was too stupid to obey. \nI found an object with a sharp edge. \nIf he doesn't want to drink from me, I'll make him to. \nBritt, I know your ready to die but I'm not so please stop this madness for my sake! \nThis time I completely ignored it. \nI picked up the object and rose it above my wrist. \n\"What are you doing?!? Sit down! Now!\" Cole's cold voice ordered again but being the idiot I am, I disobeyed. \nAgain! \nI brought the object close to my wrist and slid the sharp edge across the numerous veins in my wrist. \nAfter a second or two, blood started gushing out of the fresh cut in my wrist. \n\"What did you do?!?\" Cole's once cold voice was now filled with venom. \nI shrugged. As if I hadn't made the situation bad enough. \n\"Just what I thought was right\". I choked out. \nI was feeling way too much pain 'cause I couldn't resist pain for long. \n'I wish I never knew someone called Brittany Rieles' \nMy subconscious huffed. \nBut you're stuck with me anyways. \nBefore I knew it, Cole was already in front of me. \nHe held my wrist tightly. I saw something flash in his eyes at the sight of my blood. \n'What have you done Brittany?!? We're going to die a painful death all thanks to you' \nCole licked off the blood that was violently gushing out of my wrist. He licked it clean. \nHe then bared his fangs at me before burying his head in my neck. \nAn excruciating pain erupted from my neck as Cole sank his fangs into my neck. \nJust when I thought it couldn't get more painful, Cole sank his fangs deeper into my neck. \nI could hear the sound of my heartbeat slowly fading off. Low growls of satisfaction erupted from his throat as he sank his fangs even deeper. Draining whatever bit of blood that was left in me. \nHe withdrew his fangs from my neck. \nIt's over! \nI survived! I really survived! \n'Wrong! I don't think he's ready to let go'. \nTurns out my subconscious was right. \nAgain. \nHe sunk his fangs into my neck again. The pain was even more excruciating than the last one. My knees gave in. I wrapped my arms around his neck for support as he continued drinking from me in satisfaction. \nThe world around me became blurry. The sound of my heartbeat had faded completely. I felt really lightheaded. Cole's low growls faded too. \nThis was it! I was going to die! I didn't survive it! I was going to die a painful death, not a peaceful one. \nI loosened my hold on Cole's neck as I let myself fall. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nI hope you liked this chapter. I know it's short but it felt like the best place to end it. \nI'm really sorry for the late update too. \nOh and, I'm gonna reveal the title of my new story next week. I'll add the description too!!! \nI've been too busy with the new story that I almost ran of ideas for this story.

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nBrittany's POV \nI groaned loudly as I tried to adjust to the brightness of a really familiar room. \nAfter I finally adjusted to the light, I tried to sit up and I wish I didn't. \nPain seeped through my whole body. \nApart from the fact that my mind was hazy, I felt extremely weak and my neck felt really sore. \nI rubbed my neck, hoping that it would make the soreness go away or something- \nHow stupid of me? I only succeeded in increasing pain. \nI looked around, hoping to see Cole but I was greeted with the mild warmness and emptiness of the room with me being the only living creature in it alongside the items that made it a room. \nAfter three attempts, my final move to sit up succeeded. \nJust as I reached out for the glass of water on the table beside the bed, the door opened. \nMy hand stopped midway as I stared in awe at the jaw dropping man that was standing right before me. \nHis hair was a bright golden color and he had striking golden eyes to match his hair color. It looked soooo cool. His face was well chiseled and I could see his well defined muscles through his tight fitting shirt. \nI swear I saw him roll his eyes and he did it so perfectly. \nIt took ten seconds before I could form a sentence. \n\"W-who are y-you?\" I stuttered. \n\"Isn't it obvious?\" He said. \nEven his voice sounded so sexy. He seemed so perfect. \nBut it also sounded oddly familiar. I couldn't really place where I heard that voice from. \n\"Seriously?!? You don't recognize me, Britt?\" He said. The surprise in his voice was undeniable. \nWait a minute, is he Cole?!? No way! \nI acted dumb. Just in case he wasn't Cole. \n\"Umm, I really don't know who you are, I haven't met you before\". I said innocently. \nIt was feigned innocence actually. \n\"Drop the pretence Britt. You know it's me already so what's the use of your feigned innocence?\" He said like he actually read my thoughts. \nNo way! Cole couldn't be this hot. Or maybe he could. \n\"Thanks for the compliment and yes, I'm really Cole\". He said. \n\"What happened to you?\" I said in awe. \n'Isn't it obvious? You never cease to be stupid' \nFor a minute, I thought this stupid voice was gone for good but I guess it was just taking a rest in my mind. \n'You wouldn't get rid of me that easily, trust me'. It said. \nI groaned at it and returned my attention to the man that claimed to be Cole. \nWhy is he claiming to be Cole? \n\"That's because I am Cole\". He said as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. \n\"It's hard to believe and why are you acting like you can read my mind?\" I asked suspiciously. \nI know it's a stupid question but it deserves an answer, doesn't it? \nMaybe I said my thoughts aloud. \n\"That's because I can read your mind\". He pointed out. \n\"No way!\". I said. \n\"Believe it or not. Now stop acting like I'm some alien and get dressed. Join me downstairs in twenty minutes\". He ordered and left the room. \nWhat's with the attitude anyways? \nI shrugged it off and walked into the bathroom. \nI decided to take a look at myself in the mirror. \nI was a frumpy mess. \nMy hair was a big mess, dried blood was smeared on my left cheek and neck, I looked really pale. \nI cringed at my appearance and decided to take a quick shower. \nAfter my shower, I wrapped a towel securely around my chest and walked out of the bathroom and picked up the dress I wore the first day we arrived. \nI still felt slutty but it's not like I had another choice apart from my blood stained oversized T-shirt. \nI went downstairs and saw Cole talking to a woman. They were actually laughing. I've never seen Cole laugh so much. That must be his girlfriend or fianc\u00e9e or something. \nI felt a pang of jealousy hit me. \nWhy the hell am I getting so jealous? \nWell, she was really pretty. She had dark blonde hair and had similar golden eyes as Cole. She was tall, almost like Cole but he was considerably taller. She seemed so nice to Cole. Her smile made her prettier. \nI felt so disgusting compared to her. \nCole noticed me and then they walked towards me. \nTaking a closer look at her, she was prettier than I imagined. \nReluctantly, I bowed. \n\"Master Cole and Mistress-\" I said with my head still bowed. \n\"Rhea. Princess Rhea\". She said, her voice was so smooth. \"Nice to meet you Brittany, Cole's told me about you. He wouldn't stop talking about you\". \nReally?!? \nI raised an eyebrow and looked at Cole. \nI wasn't surprised that his face didn't show any emotions but I was disappointed. \n\"No. If anything, I hardly ever say her name\". He said. His voice was as cold as ice. \nOkay, that hurt. \n\"Liar! It's so obvious that you're lying Nicky\". She said. \nThey seemed pretty close... I mean, I'm not the only one that heard the nickname. \n'It's so obvious that you're lying Nicky'. I mentally mimicked. \n'You have no reason to get jealous'. My stupid subconscious said. \n'Who says I'm jealous?' I asked. \n'Well, it's obvious'. \n'Whatever'. I replied and tuned it out. \n\"Who says I'm lying?\" Cole asked, obviously irritated. \n\"Well, your face says it all Nicky\". She said. \n\"Stop. Calling. Me. That!\" He said, spacing out each word. \n\"You know I won't Nicky\". She said. \nTheir small fight was amusingly interesting. \nBy then, he was burning holes into her face with his hard stare. \n\"Don't give your big sissy that look\". She said. \nWait a minute, big sissy?!? \nSo she was his sister. There was actually no reason to get jealous. \nUrgh! This subconscious seemed to be always right. \nThis comment may be offensive. \n\n\n"

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nBrittany's POV \nIt was finally time to leave. \nI tailed after Cole with my head bowed down as we walked down the hallway. \nWe were going to meet Rhea. She told Cole that she found out something incredible. \nI wonder what it is. It's probably some crazy discovery. \nWe finally got to a golden door that flung open after Cole knocked twice revealing Rhea in her unblemished beauty. \nHer hair, though it was slightly disheveled, was packed sideways in a ponytail. She was wearing a black dress which was parted by the side, slightly revealing her thighs. She didn't have any shoes or jewelries on yet but she still looked so sexy. \nI'm straight but some females just look so beautiful, like damn! \nShe smiled warmly as she ushered me and Cole into her luxurious room. \nCole's room was more spacious, definitely, but the decoration made the room more elegant. \nThe major color was gold. \nLiterally everything in her room had a golden touch on it, even the black and golden walls were not excluded. \nHer queen sized bed was also gold. The only things that were excluded were the sheets and duvets which were white and floral patterned respectively. \nShe dragged Cole into what I assume was her closet and shut the door behind them. \n'How rude?' My subconscious snorted. \nYeah, that was rude. \n*** Cole's POV \nI stared at the papers blankly. \nThis was totally unbelievable! \nI really didn't know how to spill the information to Britt. \nIt'll break her. Like she'll be really unhappy. \nI couldn't help but read her thoughts. \nShe called Rhea crazy. \nShe was still rambling about how rude Rhea was to close the door like that. \nWell, it was for her own good. \n\"She actually thought we were dating when you first introduced us and now she's grumbling about my rudeness\". Rhea chuckled. \"She thinks I'm a crazy twin. Now I know why you talk about her so much\". \nShe can also read thoughts. It's also one of the many abilities she got. \nUnlike me, she can't read through Britt's memory because I drank her blood. \nLemme explain well. \nVampire royals are graced with many abilities after their coming of age ceremony. \nSome royals are often able to read minds but they can't read through the memories unless they drink the person's blood. \nThere's also a limit to reading of minds when a vampire doesn't drink the person's blood. \nWhen you haven't drank from the person, some thoughts will be easily blocked from you but if you have, it'll be really difficult to block the thoughts. \nThat's what applies with me and Brittany. I even get to listen to her silly conversation with her annoying subconscious. \nI don't get to have conversations with my subconscious anymore but it's always there to help when I need some advice. \nAfter I woke up on the glass table, I found out that they actually left Brittany on the floor after she passed out. \nI was told that I almost killed her and she only had 40% chance of living by the time we fell unconscious so all they could do was to leave her there not even attempting to stop the bleeding. Her chances of surviving were definitely lower because she seemed to have lost quite a large amount of blood. \nI was furious. I couldn't fire the guards on duty because I didn't employ them but that didn't mean I didn't do my emotions justice. I beat them up to pulp after I made sure Brittany was safe. \nDad heard about it and got suspicious. He even tried to persuade me to get another pet but that didn't work either. \nBefore I came of age, I knew I had feelings for Britt and I succeeded in keeping my feelings at bay but now I couldn't do that anymore. All my efforts were proven abortive so there was only one way. \nI had to avoid being my usual casual self with her. I had to enforce some Master  and Pet laws. The laws I hated so much. \nThose laws didn't bother me before but after I met Britt, I suddenly felt like strangling those stupid laws. \nBut that was so impossible. \nAfter the ceremony, I felt different. I sounded different too but I didn't know what I looked like. I didn't want to know. \nAfter finishing up some documents, I went to check up on Britt only to find out that she was awake. \nI felt so relieved. I wanted to wrap my arms around her petite figure but I knew better than to do that. \nI noticed that her hand stopped going further to pick up the glass of water on the table when she saw me by the door. I wasn't surprised that she was checking me out, not even batting an eyelash. \nHer jaws even dropped. I rolled my eyes at her as she continued ogling me. \nIt was obvious that she trying to say something  but the words got stuck in her throat. \nHer dirty thoughts really turned me on but- \nAfter many attempts, she finally spoke. \n\"W-who are y-you?\" She stuttered. \nShe seriously doesn't recognize me?!? \nOh yeah, I knew that before. \nBy the way she described me in her thoughts, I was actually pleased but again she could be exaggerating. \n\"Isn't it obvious?\". I said \n... \nCuriosity killed me so I walked into one of the empty bathrooms to check myself out and oh boy, did I look good?!? \nI was expecting to look older with slightly creased forehead and all but my expectations were proven wrong. \nI looked more mature and hotter too. \nNow I know why Britt ogled me for so long. \nBut why did I get a golden hair?!? I really don't like it. It's not like I dyed my hair in gold- \nWell, I was still in love with my looks. \nYeah, my looks boosted my ego. * \nI stared at the papers I was holding again and let out a huge sigh. \nI knew I had to tell her real soon because I don't want someone else telling her but the question was how in fuck's name will I say it without breaking her heart? \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nHow are y'all doing? \nIf you have any questions, feel free to PM me or just comment it. \nTill next update. \nDon't forget to vote and comment. \nLove y'all\ud83d\ude18\u2764\ud83d\ude18 \n\n\n"

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nBrittany's POV \nCole seemed tense after they came out of the other room. \nI had stopped fussing over Rhea's rudeness, I was now focused on whatever she told Cole. \nThe ride home was silent. \nCole seemed to be deep in thought and I honestly didn't know what he was like now that he had done the ceremony. \nWe finally got home after what seemed like hours. I literally jumped out of the car as soon as it pulled over. \nI couldn't wait to get out of the whore-ish red dress. \nI impatiently waited for Cole to walk over to me and grab my leash. \nHe wrapped his free arm around Rhea's waist and finally grabbed my leash. \nYeah, Rhea was going to be living with us now. \nI swear, I almost died while walking to the room with Cole and Rhea! \nThey walked so majestically, forgetting that there was a poor little girl dying to get out of her clothes for a decent.. bath. \nWe finally got to the room. Immediately Cole left the room with Rhea, I rushed into the bathroom, stripped and got into the shower. \nAfter washing myself, I applied the mint scented shampoo on my hair and washed it. \nAfter spending what seemed like more than forty minutes, I finally turned off the shower and wrapped a towel around me and then another towel around my hair. \nAfter making sure that Cole wasn't in the room, I stepped out of the bathroom and walked into the large closet. \nI picked out a white T-shirt and cotton shorts. \nJust as I was putting on my clothes, I heard the clink of the door being shut by someone. \nI quickly threw on the T-shirt and rushed out of the closet. \nCole was already undoing the buttons of his shirt. \nI cleared my throat to make my presence known, hoping he'd stop undoing his buttons but he only smiled at me and continued undoing them. \nI quickly shielded my eyes. \nI heard a low chuckle and then the sound of the bathroom door being closed a few minutes later. \nI slowly unshielded my eyes and breathed a sigh of relief when he wasn't there anymore. \nI walked to the side of the bed and sat on the floor with my hair still dripping. \nI didn't know if Cole would let me sit on his bed now that he was a different person. \nHe came in putting on a tight fitting shirt and jean pants. \nHe went out and didn't come back till night. I was incredibly bored but it's not like I could do something about it. \n\"Britt,\" He called. \n\"Yes M-master\". I said. \nI could almost see him cringe at the word 'master' but he said nothing. \n\"Get dressed. We have to go somewhere\". He ordered. \nHe should really stop ordering me around, it was beginning to get on my nerves. \nI didn't even know what to wear. \n\"Casual\". He simply stated like he read my mind. \nWhatever he said about reading my mind wasn't true, right? \nIt only exists in vampire novels and movies. \nI nodded and disappeared into the closet. \nI picked a pair of black leggings and changed into them. \nWe finally got to wherever he was taking me to (He put a blindfold on my eyes earlier). \nI felt the blindfold fall off my face. My eyes flung open almost immediately. \nAlmost as soon as they flung open, they widened. \nI realized that we were in the garden. \nI'd never been to this part of the garden. It had so much flowers. The sky was so clear so I could see a large amount of stars up there. \nThere was a table set up for two people. We walked over to the table and I picked up the bouquet I found on it. \nI read the card in the bouquet of different flowers. \n'Ready for your big day?' \nI slowly read the card till I understood what was written on the card. \nI actually forgot that tomorrow was my birthday; \nI was gonna be sixteen! \nBut it was going to be different this time. No family or friends to celebrate with. \nNormally, we always celebrated my birthday by watching movies, eating cake, ice cream and pop corn. \nIt wasn't something much but it meant a lot. \nBut Cole actually remembered. \nI smiled foolishly at that thought. I couldn't help it. \n\"Wishing you happy birthday now won't be considered early will it?\" Cole asked. \nI chuckled. \"Save the birthday wishes till tomorrow\" \n\"I guess we'll save till tomorrow then\". He said. \nIt wasn't a dinner date it was just a friendly date that didn't necessarily involve food. Only a couple of drinks and random talks \nWait, I called it a date. Well, I'll like to see it as a friendly date. Just to compensate the days of torture at the King's 'castle' \nCole seemed troubled though he was smiling. \nI could sense his uneasiness. \nAfter a couple of hours, we headed back inside. \nI changed back into my comfy shorts and got into bed. Not without asking for Cole's permission. \nHe was in bed but he was still working on some papers. \nHe's always reading documents. \nAfter studying Cole for sometime, I finally fell asleep, going straight into the world of weird dreams. \nTomorrow was my 'big day'. \n*** A/N: Hey guys. I know this chapter was pretty uneventful and boring. \nI'm currently having a writer's block but I still managed to write this chapter. \nYeah, I decided to update on Saturdays or Sundays. \nSometimes I may update otherwise so you can add MVL to your reading list or follow me to get notified when a new chapter is uploaded (I'm not forcing you) \nThat's all for now. \nDon't forget to Vote and Comment. \nBye. \nLove y'all\ud83d\ude18\u2764\ud83d\ude18        \nThis comment may be offensive. \n\n\n"

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nPicture of dress above ^^ \n\"It's time to wake up birthday girl\". Cole said. \nI was forced to open my eyes because Cole was using something light to tickle the side of my face. \nI groaned as I finally opened my eyes. \n\"Morning\". I greeted. \n\"Happy birthday\". He said in an almost whisper. \n\"Thanks\". I said with a sweet genuine smile. \n\"Time to get dressed. It's your big day and you should look flawless so I bought this dress,\" He said, showing me a box with a ribbon tied on it. \"And a couple of other things. Oh, and your gift\". He said, handing a small box over to me. \nI took it and stared in awe at the beautiful necklace he got me. \nIt was like the prettiest necklace I had ever seen. \nI opened my mouth to say a 'thank you' but I ended up squealing. \nGosh, I couldn't remember the last time I squealed. \n\"So, do you like it?\" He asked. \n\"Are you kidding me?!? I don't like it!\" I said. \nHe looked at me like I had grown two heads. \n\"I love it!\" I squealed again. \nHis expression softened. \n\"Go get changed and meet me downstairs\". He said and left. \nI went into the bathroom to brush my teeth and shower. \nIt was finally time to get dressed. \nI opened the box, revealing a blue dress. \nI brought it out of the box and studied it before finally putting it on. \nIt was a short sleeved backless dress. It hugged my figure so much I was in love with it even though it seemed too much for a pet. \nI put on a new pair of silver shoes to match and finally, the necklace. \nI applied some balm on my lips and attempted to brush my hair without pulling it off my scalp. \nAfter I succeeded in brushing it up, I styled it up... At least I attempted to. \nWhen I was sure I looked okay, I went downstairs. \nThe smell of pancakes made me realize how hungry I was. \nI traced the smell of pancakes to a small table near the kitchen. I finally found the delicious looking pancakes. \nBeside it was a piece of paper. \n'Meet me at the place I took you to last night. Wait for the next clue'. \nI smiled and went out to the garden. \nWait, he blindfolded my eyes so I didn't see the way to where he took me to the previous night. \nI guess I just need to figure it out myself. \nIt didn't take long to figure out. I discovered there was a place in the garden that had a lot more flowers than the other parts and they were specifically roses with a- slight, not so obvious opening between the roses, obviously left there on purpose. \nThe table from yesterday was still there but there was a bunch of mixed flowers on it. I took it and search for the next clue. \nAnother piece of paper fell out of it. \n'Walk further to your right and find your way here'. \nI walked further to my right as instructed by the paper. After walking a little but further, the only turn led to a dead end. \nOkay, what was I supposed to do? \nI looked around the place for a while till I noticed a flower that looked different from the other ones around. There was no other flower there that looked like it so I decided to keep it. \nJust as I plucked it out of the bushes, I heard a squeak. I noticed that there was a space between the flowers, it wasn't there before. \nI decided to push it further. \nThe door suddenly flung open itself. \nCole in his hot glory appeared behind it. \n\"How long did it take you to find this place?\" He asked. \nI rolled my eyes at him. \n\"Not everyone is as smart as you are\". I said sarcastically. \n\"Come in\". He said, opening the door wider enough for me to fit in. \nThe room was warm and cozy. The faint scent of flowers was obvious despite the smell of the mouth watering food that filled the air. \nThere was a small kitchen there too, the crazy twin was there in her glorious beauty, making more mouth watering food. \nShe finally acknowledged my presence. \n\"Happy birthday!!!\" She squealed, engulfing me into a giant bear hug. \n\"Too- tight\". I said, spacing my words. \n\"Sorry\". She apologized, breaking the hug. \"Here, I got you a present\". \nShe said, holding out a beautifully wrapped box. \n\"Awwn, thanks a lot\". I said, unboxing it. \nYeah, I'm that impatient. \nI opened the box, revealing a beautiful pair of converse. It was obviously expensive. \nI squealed. \n\"Thanks a lot\". I rushed out, engulfing her in a giant hug. \n\"That's not all. I also got these for you\". She said, revealing a small box. \nI opened it and brought a charm bracelet. \nThey were so beautiful. There were two charms on it already. \n\"Thanks soooo much! I love it!\" I said, giving her another hug. \n\"I knew you would. This shows how much we love you and how special you are to us. Cole bought it\". She said, indicating with her fingers. \nI turned to look at Cole who was already looking at me. \n\"Uh, thanks master\". I said. \n\"You can call me Cole when Rhea's with us\". \n\"So... I bought this charm. It shows how great our friendship is going to be\". She said. \nI put on the bracelet and smiled at them. \n\"Thank you very much\". I said. \n\"Okay, time for breakfast\". Cole said, clapping his hands. \nWe walked over to the table where assorted delicacies were awaiting us. My mouth watered immediately. \nThe day went by pretty fast and soon it was evening. \nRhea had returned to her room and I was in the room with my cotton shorts and oversized shirt on. The only sound heard was the sound of the shower running. \nI wished that today could just replay itself over and over again... It's just not possible but as a pet, I'll say I had the best sweet sixteen ever! \nCole came in with a T-shirt and grey sweatpants on. \nI moved over to my side of the bed as I waited for Cole to do the same but he didn't move an inch. \nI raised a perfectly arched eyebrow at him \n\"Britt, I know this might not be the best time, but I have to tell you something\". \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nI'm terribly sorry for the late update. I had a mild writer's block but I'm getting out of it already so hopefully, the next chapter will be updated early. \nI know y'all are curious to know what's gonna happen next...

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nBrittany's POV \nI stared at the papers in mixed shock and confusion. \n\"What's this?\" I asked. \nHe hesitated before answering. \n\"Britt, I really don't know how to tell you this but you're not sixteen, you're nineteen\". Cole said calmly. \nI mean, how could he say something like that so calmly when I was raging inside. \n\"What do you mean? I'm not three you know, I can tell my age so why will you say I'm not sixteen?!\" I yelled. \nI wasn't taking this lightly. This had to be some kind of joke. Nineteen? Really? \n\"You've been using a fake birth certificate Britt, your dad's room was searched and we found the original certificate\". \nOkay, it was definitely not a joke. But... How? \n\"W-why did he have to do that? It feels like my whole life has been a lie! Why would he make a fake certificate? Why would my age be a lie?\" I said, the tears were threatening to spill out. \nThis was crazy! \n\"I know it's really hard to believe. I don't know how Rhea found it out but she just knew something was wrong- but we also found out something else\". \n\"Another bad news?\" My voice cracked. \nHe nodded slowly. \n\"I honestly don't know how to tell you now. Maybe we should forget about it\". He said hesitantly. \n\"Just say it. Either way, I'm still gonna find out so why don't you just tell me now?\" I said. \n\"You are really not gonna take this lightly\". He said, still hesitating. \n\"But I have the right to know, right?\" \nHe nodded. \nAfter a two minutes of silence and hesitation, he spoke up. \n\"He's dead\". He said. \nI scrunched up my brows in confusion. \n\"Who's dead?\" I asked. \nHe hesitated a little bit more. \n\"Your- your dad's dead\". He said. \nThat was all it took for me to break down. My knees weakened as I fell to the floor. He did a lot of things that were not nice to me but I still loved him. \n\"D- dad's dead?\" I said, tears running down my cheeks. \n\"He has been dead before you were sold. Your so-called step mom is a demon. A demon possessed your dad's body, I don't know what they wanted but they had to get rid of you to achieve whatever they wanted\". He said before finally noticing my messed up state. \nHe walked up to me and picked me up bridal style, placing me on the bed. \nThe information was not settling well with me. A lot of thoughts were going through my head at that moment. \nMy whole life had been a lie! \nMy body shook as I cried uncontrollably. The temperature of the room suddenly increased. \nI gasped for breath as my vision became blurry. \nWhat was happening to me? \n\"Brittany!\" I heard Cole yell. \nHe was so near yet his voice was so distant. \n\"C-cole\". I whispered. \n\"Stay awake Britt, don't close your eyes\". \nThrough my blurry vision, I watched Cole pick up his phone as he hurriedly tapped on it. He placed the phone on his ear and said some things I could not hear or understand. \nI was struggling to stay awake but I knew I couldn't struggle for long. \nThe room was spinning. \n\"Stop it!\" I screamed. \"Stop spinning, please\". I said as my head ached. \nI wanted the pain to go away. I didn't want to feel this way. \nTwo strong arms wrapped around me. There was no body heat but I felt safe. \n\"Cole, t-take it a-away. It hurts so much\". I said. \n\"You have no idea how much I wish that it was possible but it's not\". He said, his voice still sounded distant and it was getting more and more distant. \nHe muttered soothing words, running his hands through my hair. \n\"Just hold on a little longer\". He said. \nHis voice was the only thing keeping me awake. \nHe continued muttering words to sooth me. \nI felt another tear run down my cheeks. \nMy body was shaking vigorously. I found it really hard to breath, everything seemed to slow down. \nI heard a light knock on the door. \nThe sound of the knock made my head ache so much. \nThe two arms wrapped around me left me, the gut feeling in me returned. \nI really couldn't hold on anymore. \nI struggled to stay awake but it got more difficult. Black dots filled my vision till it was pitch black. \nI heard Cole's faint voice before I finally zoned out. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nI'm sorry for the short chapter. \nIt's kinda devastating for Britt right? \nI didn't have time to proofread so I'm sorry for all the mistakes. \n** \nShoutout to: \nuser44047095 \nAnd \nlandr329 \nThanks for your amazing contribution, Thanks so much for following me and I also appreciate the votes.

Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nCan't believe I've written thirty chapters already!!! \nThanks so much for your motivation. \n*** \nBrittany's POV \n** Not talking to Cole for weeks was really difficult. \nAfter telling me the heart breaking news of my whole life being a lie, Cole figured out I needed some time alone which I was grateful for but I finally decided that I couldn't dwell in the past forever. It's not like I could change the past... I wanted to move on and start a new life as a nineteen year old. It's not that hard. \nWho am I kidding?!? \nIt was going to be very difficult but I just had to. \nIt took days for me to believe that I was an orphan now and that the man I had grown to know for years was dead. \nIt was time to stop being a cry baby, I had to grow up! \nI got up from the bed and walked into the bathroom. \nI knew how I looked even before I looked into the mirror. \nI mean, you don't expect a girl who spent weeks crying all day to look good. \nI hadn't had a decent bath for weeks, I only thought of brushing my teeth twice in weeks and food? I only depended on fruits when I was hungry which was not so often. \nWell, all that was going to change now. Brittany Riele was a stronger person now. \nI looked worse than I predicted. \nMy hair was a bushy mess, I had dried tear stains all over my cheeks, pale skin and dark circles around the eyes. \nI stripped and turned on the shower. My once stiffened body relaxed at the feel of the cold water. \nAfter scrubbing my body, I wrapped a towel round my body and hair then applied a little amount of toothpaste on my toothbrush. \nI brushed my teeth vigorously. After that, I used some mouthwash. \nFeeling satisfied, I walked into the closet. \nI picked out a pair of jeans and a blue T-shirt and slid them on, putting on a pair of white converse to match. \nI brushed my towel dried hair and put it up in a rough bun. \nNow, where could I find Cole? \n... \nYes! His office! \nI stepped out of the room, determined to find Cole. \nI met Chloe on my way. We were so happy to see each other again. \nWe chatted for some time before I set out to my original mission. \nWith the help of Chloe's direction, I found Cole's office. \nA bulky guard was currently standing by the door, trying to intimidate me with his height and dark looks but it wasn't working anyways. \nI cleared my throat. \n\"I'm here to see Master Cole\". I said, maintaining a normal voice. \n\"He's not here\". His equally dark voice said. \nHis eyes narrowed. \n\"You're a pet, aren't you?\" He asked. \nI nodded. \n\"Why aren't you putting on your collar?\" He asked, still doing his very best to intimidate me. \n\"Because my Master, who happens to be Prince Cole has it\". I lied. \n\"I see. It isn't proper for you to walk about without a collar-\" He said. \n\"I know, that's why I'm here\". I cut him short. \n\"Um- he's not in his office right now. He went to receive some guests so wait here, he'll be back soon\". He said. \nAlmost reluctantly, I agreed. \nAfter what seemed like hours, which was probably a few minutes, Cole appeared. \nHe had company too. \nThat is, Rhea with another girl whose beauty made me feel more disgusting than Rhea's. \nRhea wore a scowl on her face and Cole's almost blank face didn't look exactly pleased. \nThe girl clung onto Cole's arm like her life depended on it, making a deep scowl form on my face too. \nWho the hell was she?!? \nHe noticed my presence and I swear, I saw him breath a sigh of relief. \n\"What are you doing here?\" He asked coldly. \nMaybe I was hallucinating when I said I saw him breath a sigh of relief. \n\"Um- I wanted to g-get my collar... Master\". I stuttered, hoping he'd get the hint. \n\"Cole, who's she?\" Her sickening sweet voice said. \n\"She's my pet, Brittany. Pet, meet Larissa\". He introduced. \nWay to go! \nPet! Really?!? \nNo need to get your pants in a twist Britt, he has to call you pet or else you wanna arouse suspicion. \nOkay, that was actually true. \n\"You haven't killed this one yet,\" She said, more like she was talking to herself. \nCole stiffened. \n\"That's a good thing. I must say your self control has improved\". She mused. \nWait, Cole killed his past pets?!? \nI watched as the so-called Larissa kissed Cole on the cheek. \nI hated her already. \nRhea snorted in an unladylike manner. \nMaybe I'm not the only one who hates her. \nCole's expression was blank. \nI suspected he wasn't in a good mood either. \n\"She's gonna be staying with us for a couple of weeks. Pet, take her to her room\". Cole said, slightly annoying me. \nWeeks? Not days?!? \n\"Yes Master\". I said with my head bowed. \nI took her things and led her to her room. \nShe was a real bitch! \nShe acted so superior that I had the urge to hit her on the head. \nShe made me arrange her clothes into the closet according to their color! \nI wanted to hit her so bad. \nDidn't she have a freaking pet?!? \nShe finally let me go after helping her with her disgusting hair. \nI was fuming by the time I got to the room. \nCole was sitting on the bed, flexing his muscles. \nI slammed the door behind me, making Cole notice my presence. \n\"You finally decided to come back huh?\" I said. \n\"I'm gonna avoid that office as much as I can. I can't have Larissa clinging onto me like a love struck puppy everyday\". He said. \nOh, he doesn't like her too! \n\"Yes I don't\". He said. \nWait, he seriously wasn't kidding when he said he could read my mind?!? \n\"Of course I wasn't\". He said. \"Oh, I really don't know why Larissa's beauty made you feel disgusting, I think your better than her\". \nThat moment, fireworks exploded in me as my stomach did a back flip. \nHe really had a way of getting me. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nHope you enjoyed this chapter. \nWhat do you think about my new character, Larissa? \nShe's a major bitch right? \nWell, she's gonna be in a lot more chapters so you have to tolerate her. \nHow's you week been? \nReply in the comment box below. \nDon't forget to vote, comment and share. \nLove y'all\ud83d\ude18\u2764\ud83d\ude18 \nP.S: More than four thousand reads!

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nBrittany's POV \n* \"So- how're you feeling now?\" Cole asked. \n\"Good\". I replied. \nI was currently sitting on my side of the bed with my back rested on the headboard. I was actually having a comfortable conversation with Cole. \n\"Come here\". He said, patting the space beside him. \nI crawled over to the space and made myself comfortable by resting my head on his hard chest. \nYup, you heard that right. I couldn't just ignore the fact that his chest was bare. \nI've always wondered how those abs and packs felt... At least I felt his abs today... I could feel his packs some other time... Or maybe now. \nYou're probably wondering since when did I start thinking about his abs and packs... Staying away from him for a few weeks brought back different feelings along with weird thoughts you wouldn't want to know about. \nHe absently played with my hair as I hummed random tunes. \nMinutes later, I felt his body leave mine. \nI looked up to see that he was staring. \nHis stare was very intimidating that I had the urge to look away but I had to win it. I couldn't look away. \nI finally gave up. It was no use engaging in a stare battle with a vampire, especially one with intimidating golden eyes. \nI opened my mouth to say something but something else crashed on it. Something soft and plump. \nIn full realization, I gasped on Cole's lips. \nHe kissed me! He freaking kissed me again!!! \nHis mouth moved in rhythm with mine. \nHe swiped his tongue against my bottom lip, asking for entrance but this time, I was reluctant to give in. \nI heard a slight groan from him. \nI felt a sharp prick on my lips as a slight gasp escaped my mouth. \nCole seized the opportunity to slide his tongue into my mouth. \nHis warm tongue glided over mine, exploring every inch of my mouth. \nI closed my eyes and almost moaned in pleasure when he sucked on my bottom lip. \nMy hand found it's way to the back of his head as I tugged on his hair gently. \nA silent moan escaped his lips. \nHe liked it. \nI did the same thing over and over again. \nI sucked in a breath as he bit on my earlobe. \nFuck! It felt so good. \nHe bit it harder, sucking it lightly. This time, earning a throaty moan from me. \nI felt him smirk against my skin. \nOur little make out session was interrupted by a knock on the door. \nWho the hell was that?!? \nCole didn't look happy about it too but he reluctantly got up to open the door. \n\"Larissa? What're you doing here?\" He asked coldly. \n\"Babe, don't be so cold. I just decided to spend sometime with you. My room's getting too lonely\". \nI cringed at the use of the word 'babe' but said nothing. \nI quickly scampered over to my seldom used corner. \nI guess I did that at the right time cause the next thing I knew, Larissa was in the room. \nBitch! \n\"Hey pet\". She said, giving a small wave. \nI frowned at the name 'pet' \nWho the hell does she think she is?!? \nInterrupt my you-know-what, call Cole 'babe' and now me, 'pet' \n'Don't think too much, she's trying to read your thoughts'. Cole's voice echoed in my head. \nI managed to think about other unimaginable things like a girl looking all green in the face with green puke all over her... Just so you get an idea of my thoughts. \nFrom the my side of view, I saw her cringe in disgust. Take that you creep! \nShe still lingered in my head so I kept up my disgusting thoughts. \nNegative emotions washed through me as she sat on my side of the bed. \nCole attempted to leave but she pulled him back. \n\"What?\" Cole asked harshly. \n\"Why are you leaving?\" She asked in a sickly sweetened high pitched voice. \n\"I'm not leaving. What's wrong in wanting to put on a shirt?\" He asked. \n\"Babe, I like you like this. There's no need to put on a shirt\". She said, shamelessly eye fucking him. \nI mentally cringed in disgust. \nI didn't expect Cole to stay, but he did, and he also let her do things to those amazing abs and packs! \nI felt so jealous but at least I hadn't done anything yet. I just had to endure this torture for one night, right? \n*** I was wrong! \nLarissa didn't leave! \nI watched Cole get more frustrated as the week passed by. \nShe stayed glued to his side. \nAt least I had some privacy now that she had followed Cole to some meeting. \nHours later, Cole barged in. He was fuming. His golden eyes had darkened. \nLarissa scrambled in after him and attempted to touch him. \n\"Don't\". He said darkly. \"Touch me\". \nWhat the hell! Since he came of age, his aura had become stronger but now darkness radiated off him. \nEven his voice gave me the creeps. \nI wish I could do something but I couldn't give myself away. \n\"Pet, over here\". Larissa said. \nI didn't need to be called twice. \n\"You know your master more than I do, how can I calm him down?\" She asked. \n\"I really don't know. This is the first time he's gotten so angry since he came of age\". I replied with my head bowed. \n\"You're just as useless as I thought you'd be\". She said. \"Well, I'll be leaving. He's too scary to be with now. You'd better leave too or you'll be dead in a couple of minutes\". \nWith that, she left. \nI actually had the chance to leave. I really didn't know how to calm him down since he was different from the Cole I knew... His pureblood was taking over. \nI wanted to run so badly but I stayed rooted to where I stood. He was a freaking vampire for crying out loud! He could catch me before I even had the chance to move a muscle. \nHis attention diverted towards me. His dark eyes stared deep into my soul. \n\"Leave\". He said. \nJust one word sent chills down my spine. The tone of his voice made me fear him more than I ever did. But I couldn't leave him so I shook my head. \nWell, that was a mistake. Vampires didn't like being disobeyed. They didn't like the word 'No'..... At least Cole didn't. \nHe took daring steps towards me while I took steps back till I hit my back against the wall. \nNow I was trapped. \nSay your last prayers Britt. \n... Lord, I'm really sorry for burning Evelyn's favorite scarf as an act of revenge... I promise, I won't do it in my next life. I'm also sorry for scribbling on Claire's diary. I got angry and now I really regret it, I really do. I promise I won't do it in my next life. Lord, I know I've had unholy thoughts about my master... Please forgive me... \nI kept naming all my sins and asking for forgiveness, not realizing that Cole already had my two hands caged in one of his. \nI squirmed when I felt his other hand lingering on the hem of my white T-shirt as his hot breath fanned my face. \nI became conscious of what I was wearing. A white T-shirt and shorts that stopped just below my bum. \nWhy did I wear it?!? I thought they'd be out for the whole day. \nLord, please forgive me. \nHis hot tongue licked my collarbone. \nLord, please... \nWhat the hell was he doing? \nHe roughly nibbled on the spot behind my ear. \nLord... \nHe repeated it again, earning a rather loud moan from me. \nHe knew I liked it. \nHe was seducing me to death. \nI couldn't fight back so I just enjoyed my last minutes of pleasure. \nHis grip loosened a bit and I was able to free one of my hands from his grip.... Almost immediately, I ran my hands through his hair, slightly disheveling it. \nMy limbs felt weak as he sucked on the spot above my collarbone rather roughly so I wrapped my legs around his waist. \nI didn't know if it was him or his pureblood doing it and I didn't care, I was going to die soon anyways. \nI was so engrossed that I didn't notice that the anger in his eyes was no longer evident. Something else filled it. \nLust. \nHow would I ever be able to control this? \nWeren't Master-pet relationships against the law? \nWas this even a relationship? \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people!!! \nI'm so so so sorry for the late update. \nI was too lazy to update but when I saw how much you guys loved my story, I decided it was time to stop being lazy. \nYou guys are so awesome! \nMVL now has over 6000reads! \nI'm so thankful for everything. \nI'll try to update the next chapter ASAP!!! \nWhat do you think about their little make out sesh? \nWhat do you think made Cole so angry? \nComment it below. \nTill next update!!! \nLove you guys sooooo much\ud83d\udc96\u2764\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc96\u2764\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc96 \n\n\n"

Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nCole's POV \n* I was aggravated! \nLarissa tried to touch me but she should have known better. \n\"Don't- touch me\". I said, barely recognizing my voice. \nMy pureblood was taking over fast. I needed to control it. \nI watched the short conversation between Britt and Larissa. \nLarissa finally left. \nMy attention drifted towards Britt, my hot as hell pet. \nShe looked- scared. I didn't want her to be scared of me... \n\"Leave\". I said, hoping she'd leave so I wouldn't do what I wasn't supposed to do. But she refused. I didn't like it and she knew it but she didn't want to leave me. \nI took slow daring steps towards her. \nI didn't know how much I could restrain myself seeing her in those shorts... She didn't even know that her white T-shirt showed off her black bra. \nWhile she was still saying her last prayers, she didn't even know that I was right in front of her. I caged her hands in one of mine. \nI realized I couldn't resist it anymore. She should have left when I told her to. \nI shamelessly ogled her body. I found one of my hands lingering on the hem of her shirt. \nShe noticed this and squirmed. \nFuck! Does she have to look this hot?!? I should have ordered for a really ugly pet, not one that was two times hotter and prettier than most vampire females. \nI moved my face closer to hers. \nI licked her collarbone, trying to savor her taste. \nMy impatient pureblood made me nibble on a spot behind her ear rather roughly, trying to find her weak spot. \nI repeated it again, earning a moan from her and boy, did that turn me on? \nMy pureblood wanted to explore her body but I knew that would just take it to another level, making things complicated. \nWhile trying to resist the urge, my grip on her hands loosened slightly, she wriggled one hand from my grip. \nAnd then she ran her hands through my hair. A moan almost escaped my mouth but I managed to suppress it. I didn't want her to please me, at least not yet. \nI sucked on a spot above her collarbone which was likely to be another weak spot. I was right, this one made her go weak in the knees. \nHer slender legs wrapped around me as she lifted her eyes to stare at me. \nI had other things to do in the morning but I couldn't help but watch her sleep throughout the night. After all, sleep wasn't a necessity to me. \nI didn't know what to call what was between us but what I knew was that I was falling for my pet. \nIt felt so wrong yet so damn right. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nI know this chap is super short but it's just like a filler chapter to let you guys know what was actually going through Cole's mind that night. \nStarting from the next chapter, things will get... Umm.... I dunno what to call it. \nYou just wait and see, I know you'll like it. \nWoah, this is like the shortest chapter so far! \nWe have 613 words including the author's note! \nNext chapter will be better, I promise. \n~You guys are the best readers in the world! \nYeah, I'm so happy right now and that's because of you guys! \nUrhn, maybe I should stop it now...

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nBrittany's POV \n*** A weight shifted beside me, making me aware of the sleeping beauty beside me. My eyes shifted to his disheveled golden hair that reached above his eyebrows, his long eyelashes-  wait, he had long eyelashes? \nIt made him more beautiful. \nI noticed his flawless pale skin and those ever so soft and plump lips. Making me want to lean in and kiss him.  I didn't notice the smirk playing on his lips till he opened his eyes. \n\"Wanna kiss me huh?\" He asked, raising an eyebrow. \nI could feel the heat crawling up my cheeks. Screw this mind reading ability! \n\"Hmm, maybe I should read your thoughts more often\". He said thoughtfully, getting up on his elbow. \n\"I- I huh... I umm-\" I was totally speechless. \n\"You what?\" He asked with an amused expression on his face. His tone was so seductive. He inched his face closer to mine. \n\"You know, you're such an amusing creature. I've had a few pets before you but you, you're different\". He whispered in my ear. \nHe gently nibbled on my earlobe, almost earning a moan from me but my teeth and lips saved me from the embarrassing noise. \nSuch small actions brought out so many reactions out of me. Again, I had to decide if what was happening was actually wrong or right. I was so indecisive... It had to stop at least until I could put a name to what was between us. \n\"S-sorry, excuse me\". I said and rushed into the bathroom. \nI leaned my head against the bathroom door. I knew I was falling for my master. It hurt to know that there was nothing I could do about it. I was just an ordinary pet so I had to forget about my feelings. \nI didn't want to fall for him. Hell, I didn't even know if he felt the same way. Even if he did, obstacles were always there. The council, all the kingdoms in our region, the law, everything was against us. Things would get too complicated. \nAfter taking in a couple of breaths to calm myself down, I rinsed my face and went back to the room. \nCole sat at the edge of the bed. He appeared to be deep in thought. \nI cleared my throat. \n\"Umm, sorry for that\". I apologized but he didn't reply. \nI thought I saw some sort of emotion in his eyes but it was gone before I could put a name to it. \nStanding close to the door was Larissa, looking not so vibrant. Her eyes were swirling with emotions but mostly hurt and something else I couldn't quite decipher. \n\"Is it because of her?\" Her voice actually broke. \nI thought vampires didn't have emotions but Larissa proved me wrong. \nCole was the first vampire you saw showing emotions, not Larissa. \nWhatever. \nLarissa looked like she was on the verge of crying but somehow, she still managed not to. \nBut seriously, what was happening here? \n\"Tell me, is it because of her?!?\" Larissa yelled but she didn't get as much as a flinch from Cole. \nThen I got the shock of my life! A tear drop ran down her right cheek. Another tear followed, running down her left cheek but she quickly wiped it off. \n\"You- do you seriously like your pet? Like are you falling in love with her?\" She asked. \nSilence. That was the only answer she got. \nI was also curious so I was a bit disappointed. Cole just maintained a cold and emotionless face. \n\"Larissa,\". He finally spoke. \n\"I don't care if you think I'm refusing your proposal for my pet. All I know is that I'm not getting married to you. I'm not ready to get married\". He continued. \nMarriage? \n\"Do you think I want this too?!?\" She yelled. \"It was all dad's decision. I have to get married to you or Kayden's kingdom will be merged with Damon's. You know what that means, don't you?\" \n\"Since you're obviously not ready to get married, I'll tell dad to stop the wedding preparations but know this, I'm not the only person that will be affected, it'll affect your entire kingdom... Probably the entire east region\". She said. \nThat seemed to get his attention. He turned sharply to look at her. \n\"What do you mean?\" He asked. His voice was turning menacingly dark. His pureblood was surfacing. Any little slip up, his pureblood would fully surface. \nI did the first thing I could think of.  I walked over to Larissa. \n\"M- ma'am, I think his pureblood is surfacing\". I falsely stuttered, speaking in my meekest voice. \nShe nodded. No rude comment, she just nodded. \n\"I'll leave now but I have something to say so listen carefully\". She said. \n\" I- I huh.. I'm huh, you know, I'm huh- I-\" Was she trying to apologize? Maybe vampires didn't like saying 'sorry' too because Cole always avoided saying that word to everyone... Well, everyone except me. \n\"I'm huh- I apologize for always being mean to you. I just saw you as an obstacle between us, I mean, all his pets are but... I'm still surprised he hasn't ki- Never mind. I'll leave now\". She said and left. \nWell, what was that? \nMaybe she hit her head against the wall and then forgot how to behave for a slight moment, that was definitely not the Larissa that I was used to. \nI carefully walked over to where Cole was sitting and sat beside him, maintaining a safe distance between us. \n\"I'm scary, right?\" Cole asked, laughing humorlessly. \n\"N-no, I just wanted you to have some personal space\". I said. \nAt least that wasn't a total lie. \n\"You seem to have forgotten that I can read your thoughts\". He said. \nOh, that's right. \n\"I'm not scared of you. It's just your pureblood... You seem to lose control when it surfaces\". I said. \n\"But my pureblood is part of me... I've never hurt you, pureblood or not, so why can't you accept me just the way I am... Why can't you Britt?!\" The anger in his voice was really evident. \nThis vampire had to be his period because what was up with him and his weird mood changes. \nHis eyes shifted from their normal golden color to black. \n\"Cole, I'm not scared of you anymore. Now that you mentioned it, you never hurt me even when your pureblood surfaces. You're still the same Cole to me. To others, you might have changed but you'll always be the same Cole to me\". I said. \nOkay, that sounded kind of cheesy. \nI cupped his face and got lost into his eyes that were still shifting from golden orbs to black ones. \nI told him the truth. My fear of him had vanished a long time ago. I had never seen him pour out so much emotion. His eyes had completely shifted back to normal. \n\"I'm not scared of you anymore\". I said and engulfed his cold body in a warm hug. \nHe tensed up at first but later relaxed into the hug. \nHa! So it works on vampires too. \nHe hugged me back and buried his head in the crook of my neck. \n\"Do you know why I don't want to get married to Larissa?\" He murmured but I heard and shook my head. \n\"I like someone else... I'm probably falling in love with her. Do you want to know who?\" He asked. \nI curiously nodded. \n\"I know falling for her is a bit uh- illegal but trust me, I've tried to suppress the feelings but it just didn't work... It just feels impossible\". He said. \n\"She's a very amusing creature, she's beautiful without even realizing it... That girl is- That girl is you, Brittany. I think I have fallen in love with you\". \nThat moment, the world around me stopped. \n*** A/N: Hey guys! \nCliffhanger yassss!!! \nSooo, I updated this chapter for you guys so you'd be patient enough to wait for the next chapter for the next... Two or three weeks. \nI formed this chapter in a couple of boring classes... Hehehe- trust me, it killed the boredom. \nWriting is just so much fun when you don't have writer's block :-) \nThoughts about this chapter? \nDo you think Larissa was acting up or was she being sincere? \nWell, we'll find out cause I don't know too. \nCole confessed to our darling Britt!!! This may mark the great beginning of Briole... \n(Guys, ship their names too... It may be better than mine so hit that comment box below!) \nSee you in the next two or three weeks \ud83d\ude18 \nPS: (For all BTS fans) \nWhat'd be your reaction when 'Black Swan' starts playing on the radio? \n*** \nDon't forget to vote, comment and share \nBye, love y'all\ud83d\ude18\u2764\ud83d\ude18 \n\n\n"

But here I am, tongue tied but really giddy with happiness. \nBut what the hell was I supposed to say?!? \n\"You know, you don't have to say anything yet. I just had to let it out\". He said softly. \nI looked up at him and nodded. \nThen it struck me. \nYeah, my feeling for him was mutual but we both had to swallow the feelings. If I heard correctly, he was supposed to get married to Larissa. Yeah, I know he still insists he doesn't want to but what if he doesn't have a say in it at all? \nA loud sigh escaped his lips. \n\"You're worried about the wedding\". He said. \nIt was more of a statement than a question. \nI nodded. \n\"Why?\" He asked. \n\"You don't want to get married to her and she's obviously suspecting y-\" I began but he cut me off. \n\"She isn't suspecting, she knows it. She knows that I love someone else but she's not sure if it's you. She only guessed\". He said. \n\"But didn't you think something was off when she apologized to me? She doesn't look like one to apologize to people-\" I said but he cut me off again. \n\"People change, right? Maybe she had a rethink and then discovered her fault in the whole thing. She might have-\" \nThis time, it was his phone that cut him off. \nHe groaned when he checked the caller ID. His expression suddenly changed as he picked up the phone. \n\"Excuse me\". He muttered, walking towards the door. \nHe left without another word. \n*** Cole's POV \n\"People change, right? Maybe she had a rethink and then discovered her fault in the whole thing. She might have-\" \nThe buzzing of my phone cuts me off. \nI checked the caller ID. It was Malcolm calling. I thought I made it clear when I said I didn't want to be disturbed. \nI hesitantly picked it up and muttered 'excuse me' before leaving the room. \n\"What?\" I snapped once I was out of the room. \n\"Umm, Cole, I know you said you don't wanna be disturbed but the Woods-\" \nJust hearing their name made my blood boil. \n\"What do they want?\" I hissed. \n\"A meeting\". He replied. \n\"Do you care to elaborate more?\" \n\"Um- they're here with Larissa... She's crying her eyes out\". He whispered. \"She says you rejected her\". \n\"So?\" \n\"They demand your presence as soon as possible\". He said. \n\"Tell them to postpone the meeting. I'm busy right now\". I said. \n\"I tried that. They're bent on seeing you\". He said. \"Maybe they want to discuss the wedding. It's just a few days away\". \n\"There'll be no wedding\". I said. \n\"Her dad won't hear any of that\". He said. \nI sighed. \n\"I'll be there in a few minutes\". I said and hung up. \nI wasn't going to get married to Larissa. \nBritt's not the only reason for my refusal. I've never liked Larissa not to talk about loving her. We'd end up hurting each other. \nAlso, I knew they had an ulterior motive. They wanted to achieve something they couldn't achieve except they got me married to their daughter. \nI called Malcolm, he picked up at the second ring. \n\"Don't let your eyes stray for a second. I can't trust those people\". I said and hung up, not waiting for him to protest. \nI walked up to my office door and opened it. \nFour pairs of eyes turned to look at me. \nLord soon-to-be king Marcus Woods, His beloved, Valeria Woods, their oh so precious daughter, Larissa Woods and my loyal assistant, Malcolm Devlin. \nLarissa's eyes were red and puffy. I thought she didn't want this, why cry so much? \nIf she's acting up then thumbs up to her, she's a pretty good actress. \nI maintained a straight face as I gave a slight bow before making my way to the leather seat behind my desk. \n\"Prince Nicholas Vasilios,\". Marcus began. \nI cringed at the sound of my full name. I hated it when people said my full name like that. \nOnly mom was permitted to use it and... Maybe dad and Rhea but definitely not this asshole here! \n\"Woods!\" I said. My voice was low and threatening. \nI felt a wave of anger wash over me and different negative emotions followed. \nMy pureblood. I had to keep my emotions in check or my pureblood will lose control. \n\"I'm Cole. Don't you dare call my full name ever again!\" I warned, still maintaining the same tone I used earlier. \"I didn't come here for nothing. What do you want?\" \nHe relaxed into the chair. \n\"I heard something I wanted to confirm from you- Is it true? You don't want to get married to my daughter?\" \n\"Yeah, so?\" I asked casually. \n\"You agreed before preparations started\". He said. \n\"No I didn't, my dad did. So face him, not me\". I said. \n\"The wedding is supposed to be held in three days and it'll be held! That marriage must take place. You can't go around having fun while my daughter cries her eyes out here! It'll be totally unfair\". \n\"You know you can't force me, right?\" \nHis lips twitched, forming into a smirk. \n\"Not when I have this\". He said, bringing out a binder. \nHe flipped it open and my eyes slowly read the content in the paper. \nMy eyes widened when I saw my signature. \n\"What the hell did you do?!?\" I yelled. \n*** A/N: So... Hey beautiful people! \nHow'd you like this one, huh? \nYou know, I actually forgot Cole's surname and I had to go back to previous chapters where I had written it and then I discovered that I'd actually forgotten some characters. \nI know, stupid me! \nNow I'll have to read from the first chapter cause I've actually forgotten most of the things that happened and also some of the characters! \nSimply put, some old characters will be coming back! \nOh, we have three new characters! \nMalcolm Devlin, Cole's assistant that was never mentioned till now. \nMarcus Woods, Larissa's father who's a soon-to-be king. \nValeria Woods, Marcus's beloved. \n(As 'Mate' is to werewolves, 'beloved' is to vampires...

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nCole's POV \n*** That fucking asshole had the guts to fake my signature on a document that I didn't even know about! \nThe document stated that I agreed to get married to their daughter, Larissa Woods at least till the next two hundred years before I could issue a divorce. \nWhat game was he playing? \n\"So- do you still wanna get married or should we take this to the other council members?\" The bastard said with a smirk plastered on his face. \nI wish I could wipe that smirk off. \nBut he was obviously playing a game and I had to beat him at his own game. \n\"I hope you won't regret this Woods\". I hissed and left, slamming the door behind me. \n*** Brittany's POV \nI just realized that I hadn't talked to the other pets for a long time. \nI'll see maybe Cole will let me hang out with them. \nThe door suddenly opened with so much force that I thought the hinges were going to fall off. \nAn angry Cole stormed in. \nWhy was I always a victim here? \nThis time, instead of black, a crimson red color was overpowering his golden orbs. I didn't need anyone to tell me what that meant. \nBlood lust! \nHe noticed my presence and started stalking towards me. I took a few steps backwards till my back met the wall. \nWhy did I always get trapped like this? \nJust when I thought he was going to close the gap and sink his fangs into my neck, the one and only cray-cray twin saved my life by barging in. \nIf I wasn't between the wall and my blood lust filled master, I'd probably be melting her flawless skin with gross kisses. \nShe flung herself on Cole, tackling him to the ground. \nOkay, ouch! That'd have probably hurt. \nBut he's a vampire. \n\"Cole! Calm down and stop all this now!\" Rhea ordered. \nCole growled at her. \n\"Don't give me that look, Cole. Stop it! Now!\" She yelled. \nAfter a few minutes of silence, Cole's eyes shifted back to their normal golden color. \nThat was when I finally detached myself from the wall that I'd been clinging onto for dear life. \nCole ran his hands through his hair multiple times and sighed. \n\"What did I do now?\" He asked. \n\"Nothing. I came in early enough to stop you from sinking your fangs into Britt's neck\". She said. \"And oh, I didn't save you for nothing. Promise you'll stop calling me the cray-cray twin\". She said, turning in my direction. \nI nodded. \nNo promises. \n\"I heard that\". She said. \nDid I say that aloud? \n\"Yes, you did\". She said. \nOh. \nShe can read my thoughts too. \nShe smirked at me. They're not identical but they have similar personalities. \nIt's just that one's crazier. \n\"You're not gonna stop calling me that, are you?\" She asked. \nI shook my head. \n\"You can join the other pets outside. They don't really have anything doing\". She said. \nI nodded. \n\"Britt, forget about the stupid vampire rules when it's only the three of us around\". She said. \nI nodded and attached my collar go my neck. \n\"You can reply me with actual words you know, instead of nodding and shaking your head like you're dumb\". She said. \n\"Um, if you say so\". I smiled and left to find the other pets. \n~ \nI made my way to the garden. \nI met Sonia and Kyle there. \n\"Brittany!\". Sonia squealed which was kind of surprising 'cause I didn't picture her as someone who'd do that. You remember the day we first met, right? \nShe engulfed me in a warm hug. When she finally released me, she said \n\"We thought we'd never see you again!\" \n\"Britt, where have you been?\" Kyle asked. \n\"The moon\". I replied. \n\"So- where's Chloe and Andrew?\" I asked. \n\"Still busy with their masters\". Kyle replied. \n\"So- have you guys been up to these days?\" I asked. \n\"You know, Chloe lost a lot of blood during your encounter with Lord Adrian. Your master made sure she was taken care of which is quite surprising\". Sonia said. \nWait, the vampire was Lord Adrian? \n\"I told you C- Master's nice. Just don't get on his nerves and you'll be alright\". I said. \n\"Britt!\" I heard a familiar voice squeal. \nI turned to the direction of the squeal as my face brightened up as well. \nThe moment she got to where I was standing, she engulfed me in a tight hug. \n\"I missed you so much!\" She said. \n\"Me too\". I said the moment she let go of me. \n\"A lot of things have been happening lately\". I said. \n\"I know right\". She said. \"I have no idea why Larissa came back\". \n\"Oh, you know her?\" I asked. \n\"Yes. She- she kind of has a thing going on with my Master\". She whispered the last part. \nWhat the actual hell?!? \n\"You know she's supposed to get married to your Master, right?\" She asked me. \nI nodded. \n\"Well, master isn't happy about this. They've been together for so long\". She said. \n\"Wow!\" That was all I could say. \n\"I actually don't like Larissa\". She said. \n\"Me too\". Me, Kyle and Sonia said in unison. \n\"She's a major bitch\". Sonia whispered. \n\"I know right\". I said, chuckling. \n\"I heard that\". A deep voice said, making us freeze. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nStay safe during this corona period y'all. Here are some tips if you're bored as heck like I am: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHope my tips helped :) \nI'm editing all the previous chapters and right now, I stopped at Chapter fifteen (Monday 30th March, 2020) \nI like to keep record of the date. \n~ \nThis chapter is dedicated to FavourJane \nA birthday gift from me\ud83d\ude18 \nPisces baby! \n~ \nTell people to tell more people about my story. \nDon't forget to Vote and Comment. \nStay Safe! \nLove y'all\ud83d\ude18\u2764\ud83d\ude18 \nThis comment may be offensive. \n\n\n"

A deep voice said, making us freeze. \nA tall handsome figure emerged from the direction of the voice. \n\"You're Cole's pet, right?\" He asked. \nI nodded. \n\"So- you know who I am?\" He questioned again. \nI shook my head. \n\"He seriously didn't tell you about me?\" He asked, feigning hurt. \nWhat's with all the questions? \n\"I'm Malcolm, your master's assistant\". He said. \nCole has an assistant? What else do I not know about? \n\"I guess he never spoke about me\". He said. \"Why am I the only one doing all he talking? I'm not gonna kill you guys... I came here because I was bored\". \nOne of the things I've learned during my stay here's that not all vampires want dominance. Some of them are just like teenagers. A few vampires like Cole whose pureblood loves dominance, Rhea and Malcolm. They're the nicest vampires I've met so far. \n\"Introduce yourselves\". Malcolm said. \n\"I'm Chloe\". Chloe said. \n\"Nice to meet you, Chloe\". He said, flashing her a toothy grin. \nAfter the introductions, we went back to our topic of discussion. \n\"You don't like Larissa?\" Malcolm asked. \n\"Yeah\". I replied, noticing that the other pets were still intimidated by him. \nTo me, he's like a vampire who thinks ordering pets around is boring just like Cole... That explains why I didn't feel intimidate by him. \n\"You see, she isn't really a 'major bitch' she's just really stressed by everything\". He said, air quoting 'major bitch'. \n\"What do you mean?\" Sonia asked, speaking for the first time since she introduced herself. \n\"She has a lot of responsibilities on her shoulders and her parents aren't helping. I know she can be bitchy sometimes but it isn't entirely her fault\". He explained. \"You see-\" \n\"Lord Malcolm\". A voice interrupted. \nMalcolm turned in the direction of the voice. \n\"Yes?\" \n\"All pets have been called to assemble at the main hall\". The slave said. \n\"Okay, they'll be there in a few minutes\". \nThe slave bowed and left. \n\"I guess you have to get going. It was nice meeting you guys\". He said and left. \n\"He seems kinda nice\". Chloe said. \n\"Were you guys tongue tied or what?\" I asked. \n\"A pet does not speak unless spoken to\". Sonia said. \n\"But it was an open conversation. Besides, not all masters like it when their pets speak unless spoken to\". \n\"We'd better get going\". Kyle said, attaching his collar to his neck. Others did the same thing before we finally left. \nEverywhere was eerily silent as pets quietly filed into the large hall. I stood between Sonia and Chloe while Kyle joined Andrew on the other queue. \nI waved at Andrew but he just averted his eyes away from me, leaving a teeny bit of anger and confusion in me. \nAfter all the pets arrived, a black haired female vampire mounted the stage. \nShe looked around for a while before she began her speech. \n\"Pets are to be served their normal  ration from today. There's a special announcement. Prince Nicholas will be getting married to Larissa, Daughter of Lord Marcus Woods and his beloved, Valeria Woods\". \nEveryone applauded, including me. Though I wasn't happy with it. \nShe continued after the applauds stopped. \n\"Preparations for the wedding are to start today. All the Royal pets will be supplied with the clothes they'll be wearing during the ceremony. All royal pets are required to go to the third floor where they'll be taken care of till after the wedding. Regular pets will be given clothes to wear daily till after the wedding. Pets owned by lords will be given two pairs of clothing to wear daily. Obey all rules and regulations to avoid being punished. You may leave the hall\". She said and dismounted the stage as the pets filed out of the hall. \nI hurriedly went to Cole's room so I could tell him goodbye. Things definitely not going to be the same. \nWhen I got into the room, Cole, Rhea and Malcolm were already there. \n\"Britt, come over\". Cole said. \nI walked over to where they sat and took my seat beside Cole. \n\"You've heard about the wedding, right?\" Cole asked. \nI nodded. \n\"I'm not getting married willingly. I have to get married to Larissa or a lot of kingdoms will be put in danger\". \n\"I understand\". I said. \n\"Larissa's not as mean as you think she-\" \n\"Lord Malcolm has explained all that\". I said, cutting him short. \n\"Just call me Malcolm\". \n\"Okay\". I said. \"All Royal pets will be taken away to the third floor to be taken care of so I have to leave\". \n\"I know about that but that doesn't mean you can't come here\". He said. \n\"Brittany, we have a plan\". Malcolm said. \n\"What plan?\" I asked. \n\"You'll know soon enough\". Rhea said with a smirk. \"Oh, Lucas will be here in a few minutes. I'll help you with packing\". She said. \n\"Thanks\". I said. \nWe put all my clothes and other necessary stuff in a small bag. Lucas arrived a few minutes later. \n\"Wait\". Cole said as I was about to leave the room with Lucas. \n\"Huh?\" \nCole shook his head. \n\"Stay safe\". He whispered in my ear in a way that sent chills down my spine. \nI nodded. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nSo sorry for the late update. I had to do some editing. \nYes, I know it's short but this was all I could come up with. \nHope you liked this chapter. \nGuys, please check out my other story, 'The Diary'.

Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nA/N: Kindly read the announcement below to the end :) \nThis chapter is not edited. I apologize for any errors. \n~ \n\"Huh, hey\". I greeted Lucas. \nWe had been walking down the hallway  without a single word said. We weren't allowed to use the elevator so we had to take the stairs. \n\"Hi\". He greeted back. \nI don't know if I've said this before but Lucas was a really cute human.   The sandy blonde hair, the electric blue eyes, those cute dimples, everything about him was so cute. His voice was a little bit hoarse yet smooth. Yeah, I had a thing for Cole but that didn't stop me from drooling though I didn't make it obvious. \n\"We didn't get a chance to properly introduce ourselves the other day\". I said, trying to strike up a conversation with him. \n\"I'm-\" \n\"Lucas, I know your name. I was just trying to get you to talk\". I said. \nHe smiled, showcasing those cute dimples. \n\"So- how did you get captured?\" I asked. \n\"In highschool, I wasn't exactly a good guy\". He said. \n\"Bad guy\". I teased. \nHe smiled. \n\"Exactly. I was a bad guy. Not the guy that wears all black and rides a cool bike. I was a good guy who had to do bad things for bad guys\". He said, leaving me confused. \n\"I was bullied. The bad guys didn't want to get their dirty work done themselves so they made me do it. Sometimes I'd try to refuse but they always made me to do it by beating me up\". He said. There was sadness in his voice, though he tried to mask it up. \n\"You didn't tell your parents?\" I asked. \nHe shook his head. \n\"I'm an orphan\". He said with a small sigh. \"My life before getting captured by the vampires was miserable. I got captured the night one of the guys had a big fight with someone. I walked back home after midnight and boom! I found myself in the Royal pet shop\". \nI could do anything to get my old life back but Lucas here liked his new life. He preferred it to his old life. \n\"Don't give me that look\". He said. \n\"What look?\" I asked. \n\"Pity\". He said. \n\"Sorry, can't help it\". I said, smiling. \n\"But I'm fine now, really\". He said. \n\"If you say so. Does Rhea know about it?\". \n\"Yeah, I told her a few days after she bought me. She's a really nice vampire, you know\". \nI nodded. \n\"But she acts crazy sometimes\". I said. \nHe gave a small laugh. \n\"The crazier, the merrier\". He said. \"So- how'd you get captured?\" \n\"I wasn't captured. My step mom sold me to them. I stupidly believed her when she said I was going to live with a non- existent aunt\". I said. \n\"That must have sucked\". He said. \n\"Yeah, it did. I was so heartbroken\". I said. \nThat wasn't the most heartbreaking thing that's happens to me. \nI never experienced a mother's love. \nMy dad was dead. \nI believed in a fake age for years. \nTell me, which one sucked more? \nWe finally got to the third floor where Lucas and I had to part ways. A slave ushered me to the room I shared with Chloe. \nIt was a slightly large room with two medium sized beds that were beige themed. There were three doors in the room. I discovered that two of those doors led to the mini closets and the last door led to the not so large bathroom. \nI chose the bed that was at the farther end and waited for Chloe to arrive. \nIt took a while before Chloe finally arrived. After she arranged her things into her closet then sat beside me. \n\"Britt, I was wondering... How'd you end up being a vampire's pet? There are no records of you being captured or anything\". \n\"I wasn't captured, I was sold. But how'd you know that I wasn't captured?\" I asked. \n\"My master punished me by making me clean second floor for a week. That was some weeks ago while I was arranging the files in the record room and I stumbled upon your file\". She said. \n\"Oh... What about you? How'd you end up here?\" \n\"I was captured in broad daylight. At a supermarket\". \nWhat the- \n\"How in the world will they capture someone at a supermarket?\" I asked. \n\"There's something people don't know. There's a kind of boundary that's between where the vampires and humans live. Most humans don't know this so once any human crosses that boundary they'll be either captured or drugged, depending on their age. The only people that can be captured are people within the ages of thirteen and thirty. Some vampires own organizations where homeless kids are taken care of till they're old enough to be sold\". Chloe said. \nThat's a lot of information to take in. \n\"Wow!\" That was all I could say. \n\"From what I saw in your record, Evelyn Wordsworth sold you to the people in charge of the Royal pet shop before you were auctioned to Prince Cole. You weren't present at the auction. It was only a photograph of you that was presented with the file\". She said. \n\"Yup. That's right. Evelyn Wordsworth was supposedly my stepmother who turned out to be a vampire\". I said. \n\"That's-\" She began to speak but another voice interrupted her. \n\"Pets\". The voice said. \nWe turned to the direction of the voice. It was a female slave. \n\"You should get ready now. All the clothes you'd wear will be brought to you shortly\". She said. \n\"So who's gonna use the bathroom first?\" Chloe asked. \n\"You can use it first\". I said. \nShe nodded and disappeared into the bathroom. \nI lay down on my bed and began to think about my life. \nI liked my master, he liked me too but he was getting married to a female vampire. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nI know this chapter is pretty boring but it's just a filler chapter. I realized I hadn't written much about the other pets. Now we know more about Chloe, Lucas and how the capturing and sales of the pets works. \nI really wanna give shoutouts to a lot of people but I'm being a lazy ass so I'll do the real thing later but for now- SHOUTOUT TO ALL MY AWESOME READERS, VOTERS, COMMENTATORS AND FOLLOWERS! I LOVE Y'ALL!!! \n~ So that's it. \n~ \nAlso guys, please send me a Private message if you see any duplication of this story elsewhere.

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nThe other days passed in a blur till two days before the wedding. Chloe and I had been taking lessons on behavioral standard of pets for the wedding. A designer had taken our measurements the day before. I hadn't seen Cole since I left his room. I'd been hanging out with Chloe, Lucas, Andrew and Kyle when we didn't have lessons. We weren't allowed to relate with other pets that weren't Royal before the wedding so none of us had talked to Sonia. We had to be of our best behaviors because dignitaries from all over the 'Vampire Realm' or whatever where going to be present. Our meals where strictly based on diet. Also, we had been told to work out twice in the past few days. \nI didn't know what to think about me and Cole. He was getting married to someone he didn't love and I wasn't even sure Larissa was going to let me continue being his pet after their marriage. My life just got more and more messed up. \n\"Brittany, Prince Cole called for you\". A slave told me. \nMy head raced with different thoughts as I headed for his room. I was suddenly nervous. I hadn't seen him in days. My palms were getting sweaty. I softly knocked on the door and went in when I heard a voice call out from inside. \nI grew more nervous when I realized that Cole wasn't the only person in the room. Rhea was there, Malcolm was there and Larissa too. \nWhat the hell was happening? \n\"You sent for me\". I said. \n\"Yes\". Cole said. \"Sit\". \nI sat down on the couch as instructed. \n\"You're probably wondering why I called you here\". Cole said. \nI nodded. \n\"We're all here to discuss how to stop me and Larissa from getting married\". He said. \n\"Okay\". I said. \n\"We've come up with some pretty good ideas.\" Malcolm said. \"Larissa wants to get married to someone else but not Cole\". \nI looked at her. She slightly nodded. \n\"It's either we find a way to cancel the wedding or Larissa gets married to the man she truly loves.\" Rhea said. \n\"Who's the man?\" I asked though I already knew the answer. \n\"She wouldn't tell us now,\" Rhea said. \nIt's a good thing I asked. Guess I had to act like I didn't know who it was. \n\"We have to weigh the options,\" Cole said. \"Canceling the wedding could arouse suspicion so the wedding has to take place\". \n\"How?\" Everyone asked in unison. \n\"Yes. Larissa is going to be getting married to whoever she loves\". Cole said. \nLarissa tsked. \n\"You look nothing like Da- the person I love,\" She said. \n\"That's why we'll be hosting a Mask wedding\". Cole said. \n\"What do you mean?\" Rhea questioned. \n\"Everyone at the wedding is required to wear a mask. Including the bride and bridegroom,\" \n\"Won't it look a bit suspicious?\" I asked. \n\"No it won't. The wedding is a few days before the Masquerade dance festival finale\". He said. \n\"What's a-\" I wanted to ask but Cole beat me to it. \n\"It's a festival where everyone has to be present as a couple wearing the most beautiful matching handmade masks. Every year, not every vampire gets to meet their beloved because not all vampires are interested in finding their beloved. This festival makes it easier to hide the real purpose of the Mask wedding\". He said. \n\"Nikky, I never knew you were such a genius\". Rhea mused. \n\"Stop calling me that\". Cole said. \n\"What? Nikky? What about Colie?\" Rhea asked innocently. \nI snorted, trying not to laugh. \nCole glared at her. \n\"Okay, let's assume we're having the masked wedding... What about his hair?\" Larissa asked. \n\"We could easily dye it\". I said. \n\"What's his hair color?\" Malcolm asked. \n\"The lightest shade of blonde\". Larissa replied. \n\"Is he going to agree to dying his hair?\" \n\"I'll persuade him to. He could dye it back to his original hair color after the wedding,\" She said. \n\"What about his eye color?\" Rhea asked. \n\"A really light brown color... Nothing a pair of golden contacts can't hide,\" She said. \n\"He needs to learn to do some stuff like Cole. Larissa, we really need to meet him or nothing will go as planned.\" Rhea said. \n\"Uh, I uh... You guys have to promise me that you won't do anything rash.\" Larissa said. \n\"You have my word\". Malcolm said. \n\"I promise,\" Rhea said. \n\"Promise.\" I said. \n\"I have a question,\" Larissa said. \n\"Shoot,\" Rhea said. \n\"Why does Brittany have to join in this discussion?\" She asked. \"I don't mean to be rude or anything. I'm just kind of curious,\" \n\"She's uh, my only pet and one of the people I trust most.\" Cole replied. \n\"Sure. Keep telling yourself that. I know something is going on between you two. I don't mean you've fallen in love or anything but I know that-\" \nI choked on my saliva when I heard what she said. \nRhea rubbed my back till I stopped coughing. \n\"I mean maybe a sexual relationship,\" \nI shifted uncomfortably. Why was she so blunt? \n\"Okay... You're dismissed\". Cole said uncomfortably. \nI left the room and walked all the way to my room on the second floor. \nTwo feelings were whirling in me. \nExcitement and extreme embarrassment. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nI'm super sorry for the late update and the short chapter. \nI'm having a little problem with my phone so I can't use it often. \nHow's life been for you guys? \nSooooo, there'll be a mask wedding ceremony huh? \nLet's wait and see what's gonna happen ;) \nGuys, MVL has been making so much progress!

Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nIt was finally the day of the wedding. Nervous was an understatement for how I felt. I couldn't help but wonder what was going to happen if we got caught. \nI looked at myself in the mirror to do a last check. I was putting on an off shoulder sleek black dress with splits on both sides. The dress was beautiful. I was also putting on my diamond studded collar. The makeup artist had done mine and Chloe's makeup. The hairstylist had styled our hair too. \nEverything we put on was similar except out collars. Chloe's collar was beautiful just that it wasn't diamond studded. \nFor the first time in a long time, I could say I looked elegant. We were even given silver wedges. \n\"You look stunning\". Chloe said. \n\"Thanks. You too,\" \n\"Thanks.\" \nChloe's master came to pick her up later so I was the only person left in the room. Later, someone knocked one the door. It was Cole. \n\"So I'm gonna send a slave to drop you off at the pets' section. I need to stay in my room till the ritual is completed\". He said. \n\"Why are you dressed as the groom?\" I asked. \n\"If anyone sees me not dressed as the groom, they might get suspicious.\" \n\"Oh-\" \n\"Let's go\". He said after attaching my leash to my collar. \nHe suddenly stopped by the door. \n\"You look beautiful by the way,\" He whispered in my ear, making my face heat up. \n\"T- thanks\". I stuttered. \nThen we went out of the room. \n\"Your mask,\" He said, handing over a beautiful silver mask to me. \n\"Thank you- master\". I said. \n\"Make sure she gets to the pets' section.\" He told the slave. \nThe slave nodded and tugged on my leash harshly. \n\"Don't treat her with animosity. If I see as much as a scratch on her, you may as well forget about using your fingers for the rest of your life\". He threatened. \nThe slave visibly shuddered. \n\"Leave now\". Cole said. \n~ \nThe ritual had almost begun and I was so bored out of my wits. I arrived too early.  Royal pets were confined to a smaller room in the pets' section with enough foods and snacks. Cole came in to discuss some changes in our original plan with me. \n\"I was supposed to hide in my room till after the ritual but I have to meet all the dignitaries. Damon doesn't know my business relationship with them. Some of them may talk business so I'll swap with Damon when the commencement of the ritual is announced. As my pet, you have to be with me till the beginning of the ritual, okay?\" \n\"Yes, master,\" I said. \n\"Let's go now.\" He said, as he held my leash. \n~ \nAs Cole had predicted, some of them did talk about business. Some of them even made remarks about me. Remarks that made me want to snort so badly but I knew better than to do that. \nOut of all the dignitaries, only one of  them gave me scary vibes. \nLord Martin. \nHe's the second most important council member with Cole being the third. He rules a kingdom and controls the northern region. He is also highly respected by vampires and humans too. \nIt was weird though. Cole was supposed to be the council leader after his father. His father wasn't the council leader too which was very weird. All males in his bloodline were purebloods and the only pureblood males were Cole and his father. As a pureblood, they possessed the ability to become the council leader and also the most powerful royals in the entire vampire realm but Lord Martin and Lord Dexter managed to gain a higher status than Cole and his father. Something wasn't right but I was merely a pet and couldn't be involved in politics. \nWhat scared me was the way Lord Martin looked at me. It seemed to be a mix of recognition and something I couldn't decipher. Whatever it was, it scared me. \nCole didn't seem to be a huge fan of his either. \n'We have to be really careful. Martin mustn't suspect a thing'. Cole's voice rang in my mind. \n'I will'.  I replied. \n'Wait, did you just reply? How'd you do that?' \n'Dunno'. \n'That's weird. Anyways, pets will be allowed to socialize after the ritual is completed. Much words can't be said. Vampires have improved hearing abilities'. He said. \n'So we'll only communicate through telepathy.\" \n'Yeah. Martin might bring up a conversation with you when I'm gone. Answer him with caution but don't let him know you're holding back.\" \n'Aye Aye, captain'. I replied. \nThen he left. \nI returned to the room reserved for Royal pets. The other Royal pets had arrived. A lot of them. \nI almost forgot that me, Chloe, Kyle and Andrew weren't going to be the only royal pets present. Royal pets from all over the vampire realm were present too. \nIt was easy to find Chloe since the Royal pets from our kingdom were dressed a little bit better than the other pets. \nLater we found the guys too and boy, did they look hot!!! Any normal human would have drooled- that doesn't exclude me, does it? \n\"You guys look smoking hot!\" Chloe said. \n\"Thanks.\" The guys said, looking flustered. \n\"No one could look better than you guys in a suit.\" I teased. \n\"You sure? I could mention a number of vampires that'll look a hundred times hotter in just a T-shirt and jeans.\" Kyle said. \nI looked at Andrew. I hadn't apologized for what happened the day I got drunk so things were pretty much still awkward between us. \n\"Uh, Andrew, I'm terribly sorry for what happened that day. I get a little bit crazy when I'm drunk.\" I apologized. \n\"It's okay. I forgive you.\" He said with a small smile. \nI watched the ritual from where I stood at the pets' section. The ritual was going to be concluded once they marked each other in front of everyone. It was a sort of public declaration of union. \nI let out a sigh of relief when they had marked each other as each others' beloved. The ritual had finally been completed. The pets could now socialize. All the pets went out to find a dance partner. \nSomeone tapped on my shoulder, making me jump in fright. \n\"Uh, you scared me,\" I said. \n\"Miss Brittany, may I have the honor of dancing with you?\" Kyle said in a terrible British accent as he extended his hand, waiting for me to take it. \nI laughed and said \" Of course,\" \nI took his hand and walked to the dance floor with him. \n\"You know, you're not actually a bad dancer,\" Kyle said as we slowly swayed. \n\"I'm not good at dancing but you're definitely not a bad dancer.\" \n\"That, I know\". He said. \nSomeone cleared his throat behind me, making Kyle freeze. \nHis eyes widened and his face went pale. \nI turned to see who could make Kyle look so pale in a second. I paled immediately I saw him too. \nThe one and only Lord Martin. \n\"Do you mind me stealing your partner for a dance or two?\" He asked Kyle. \nI turned to look at Kyle, hoping he'd say no. \n\"Eh...um, I uh-\" Kyle stuttered. \nHe was intimidated by Lord Martin. Again, who wasn't? \n\"S- s... Sure- my lord\". Kyle said. \nI paled. \nOh no! \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nHope you liked this chapter.

Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \n'I'm dancing with Lord Martin'. I informed Cole through telepathy. \n'Stay calm, okay?' \n'Mhm'. \nI knew I had to choose my words carefully when dancing with Lord Martin. I didn't need a soothsayer to tell me that Lord Martin was a cunning and devious person. His aura said it all. \n\"Pet, you know it's a little bit surprising that Cole hasn't killed you yet\". Lord Martin said. \nI didn't know if it was a question or simply a statement so I kept mute. \nAfter a few seconds passed by without me uttering a word, I felt someone trying to access my thoughts. I knew it was Lord Martin. I subconsciously blocked him out which was weird 'cause  I can't recall ever doing that. Sometimes I didn't even know that someone was accessing my thoughts. \n\"You're really interesting,\" He said thoughtfully. \n\"What type of pet shop were you bought from?\" \n\"I'm assuming it's a royal pet shop, my lord\". I said courteously. \n\"Who sold you to the pet shop?\" He asked. \n\"I was captured and drugged, my lord\". I said. \n\"Do you have any family?\" \n\"Yes, my lord\". I said. \n\"How many?\" \n\"I lived with my dad before I was captured, my lord\". I said, trying hard not go step on his foot. He was asking too much questions already. \n\"I lived with my dad, step mom and step sister before I was captured. I do not know of any other family, my lord\". I said. \nNo questions please.... No more questions... No... \n\"How old are you?\" \nOh no, more questions. \n'He wants to know my age'  I told Cole. \n'Tell him you're eighteen'. Cole replied. \n\"I'm eighteen, my lord\". I told Lord Martin. \n\"Hmm, eighteen\". He said thoughtfully. \n\"Yes, my lord\". \nOkay, seriously, no more que- \n\"So-\" He began. \nOh no! More questions. \n\"Can you tell me how you got captured?\" He said. \n\"In detail,\" He added. \n'He wants to know how I-' \n'Don't worry. He won't ask questions again,\" Cole said, interrupting me. \nJust then, I saw a slave approach us. \n\"M- my g- greetings lord M- Martin\". The slave stuttered while bowing his head. \n\"What do you want?\" Lord Martin asked harshly, probably frustrated that our conversation got interrupted. \n\"Princess Rhea has requested the pet be brought to her,\" The slave said. \n\"Tell her I'll personally bring the pet to her when I'm done with it\". He said, dismissing the slave. \nThe fact that he referred to me as 'it' didn't go unnoticed by me. \n\"Lord Martin,\" Rhea said as she approached us. \nHe let go of me to acknowledge Rhea's presence. \n\"Ah, Princess Rhea,\" Lord Martin said, taking Rhea's hand in his. \nRhea pulled away before he had the chance to kiss it. \n\"My brother handed over this pet to me to take care of till after the ceremony.\" Rhea said. \n\"That's surprising though. The Prince Cole I know doesn't care so much about his pet.\" \n\"Not everyone is as unrepentant as you are, Martin. Also, if your definition of 'caring' is handing over your pet to your sister to take care of, then I really don't know what to say then\". She said, emphasizing the 'Martin'. \nLord Martin grinned. \n\"Princess Rhea, I haven't seen you for decades now, how about we sit down for a little chat?\" \n\"Sorry, Martin. I have more important things to do,\" She said. \n\"Let's go, pet\". She said, referring to me. \n\"Gosh! I hate that man so much that he's number one on my hate list,\" Rhea groaned as soon as we got far away from where Martin was standing. \nI chuckled. \n\"He scares me,\" I said. \n\"That jerk isn't worth your fear. He just needs to be put in his place. He can't be trusted, he's very cunning and devious,\" She said. \n\"I noticed. His aura screams evil.\" I said. \n\"He won't harm you. If he tries to, Cole will year his head into a million pieces\". \nI chuckled. \nI took a good look at Rhea. \nShe looked stunning. \nShe was putting on a backless maroon dress that reached mid thigh, showcasing her long legs. Her stiletto heels made her legs appear even longer. Her hair was styled to perfection. She was also putting on a silver necklace and a bracelet too. She had a pair of silver earrings on too. Her makeup was flawlessly done. Her beauty made me jealous. \n\"You look so gorgeous,\" I said. \n\"Thanks. You don't look bad yourself,\" \nI smiled. \n\"Rhea!\" A familiar voice called from down the hall. \nIt was Malcolm. \n\"What's up, Malcolm?\" \n\"Your dad found out,\" Malcolm said. \"He found out that Cole's not the groom\". \nI gasped and Rhea's eyes widened. \n\"H- how did he find out?\" Rhea asked. \n\"I don't know. But he pulled off Damon's mask as soon as he suspected,\" \n\"Oh no, this can't be happening,\" Rhea panicked. \n\"Calm down. Your dad and Larissa's parents are furious. It might be reported to the council. Cole being a council member makes it worse.\" Malcolm said. \n\"This can't be happening\" Rhea said. \n\"I have to go. Take Britt to Cole.\" She said and left. \n\"Let's go\". Malcolm said to me. \n~ \n\"So what's the situation like now?\" Cole asked.Though he was acting cool about it, I knew he was worried. \n\"Not good.\" Malcolm replied. \"Your dad wants to meet you\". \n\"Alright, I'll meet him now. Make sure Britt stays in-\" He was interrupted by the sound of people yelling. \n\"There's commotion outside\". Malcolm informed Cole. \n\"Obviously,\" Cole said. \nSuddenly, the door flung open with so much force that I was surprised the hinges didn't fall off. \nIt was Cole's dad. \nMemories of what happened the last time I met him flooded through my head. I disliked him. \nHe walked up to Cole. The next thing I knew, Cole was slapped across the face. \n\"Do you know what you just did?!\" He yelled in anger. \n\"What I know is that you just slapped me.\" Cole said, still acting cool about everything. \nThough, I could tell he was trying to keep his anger in. \nI knew by the way his jaw clenched and unclenched. \nBefore anyone knew it, he was slapped again. \n\"I should have killed you and your twin when I killed your worthless mother.\" His father spat. \n\"You've ruined what I worked so hard for you son of a bitch!\" He yelled. \nCole had clearly had enough of his nonsense. \nNo one expected what happened next. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nHope you enjoyed this chapter. \nWhat's gonna happen next?!? \n***Shoutout to athenabast221 for correctly guessing a question I asked in chapter nine. \n*** Don't forget to vote, comment and fan. \nTill next update. \nLove y'all\ud83d\ude18\u2764\ud83d\ude18 \nP.S: Thanks so much for the 40K+ reads.

Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nCole was losing control. \nHe had his dad pinned against the wall. \n\"Why? Why didn't you kill us the way you killed our mom? The only thing you care about is your damn reputation!\" Cole yelled. \n\"You wanted to get Larissa married to me but none of you cared about her happiness. You didn't care about mine either so we simply made your wrongs right,\" Cole said. He was already choking the life out of his dad. \n\"The only mistake you made today was calling mom worthless. I'll kill you just the way you killed her,\" Both his eyes and his voice grew darker with every word. \nJust then, Rhea rushed in. \n\"Cole! Let him go!\" Rhea screamed at him. \n\"But before I kill you, I'll ask you again. Where did you hide Rhea all these years?\" Cole said, ignoring Rhea's plea. \n\"I told you already... I found her in the woods and took care of her till she was ready to meet you.\" Cole's dad choked out. \n\"Lies! All lies! When I met Rhea, she didn't look taken care of, she looked battered! What did you do to her?\" Cole yelled, continuously choking his dad. \nRhea screamed in annoyance, making Cole stop in the process. She crouched down as tears began to stream down her face. \n\"Cole, stop... Please. He'll die if you don't stop. Please-\" Rhea pleaded. \n\"Why are you protecting him? He obviously harmed you,\", Cole said, his features softening a little. \n\"He's still our dad,\" Rhea said. \n\"He killed mom and harmed you and-\" Cole stopped mid sentence. \n\"He killed mom?\" Rhea asked, confirming what she'd just heard. \n\"Um, Rhea, calm down, okay?\" Cole said. \nRhea stood up. \n\"He killed mom,\" She said lowly. \nThen I noticed her eyes change color just like Cole's did when his pureblood was provoked. \nRhea had their dad pinned up against the wall in a millisecond. \n\"You monster! You actually killed mom and then you abused me!\". Rhea said. \nWith that statement, Cole's pureblood got provoked too. \nIf someone didn't step in, this place was going to get really bloody. Seemingly, two purebloods were on the loose. \nCole flung their dad across the room. \n\"I'll make sure I kill you!\" Cole growled. \n\"How?\" Cole's dad questioned. \"How could you two be pureblood?\" \n\"How could you be pure blooded like her?\" He questioned again. \n\"You killed mom because she was pureblood?\" Rhea asked. \n\"So what? Pureblood means danger. She was dangerous, that's why I killed her. You two are dangerous, I'll kill you too,\" \nWith that being said, he charged full force towards Cole and Rhea, baring his fangs at them. \nMaybe he forgot that he was dealing with pureblood vampires 'cause they both had faster reflexes so they had him tackled down in no time. \n\"Stop!\" Someone's voice thundered, making them stop. \nEveryone in the room bowed. \nIt was Lord Dexter. \n\"What's happening here?\" Lord Dexter. \nMoron, are you blind? \nI thought. \nCole bared his fangs at Lord Dexter. He obviously didn't like him either. \n\"Oh, the pureblood prince-\" Lord Dexter started but then he looked at Rhea too. \n\"You're pureblood too?\" He said, surprised. \"The pureblood siblings and their father,\" \nI initially thought Cole's dad was pureblood. I guess he was not. So Cole was actually the only pureblood male. \n\"This action of yours is highly despicable and unwelcome. Take them away,\" Lord Dexter ordered. \nA two black suited men stepped forward and after a lot of effort, they attached a collar to Cole's neck. Luckily, Rhea bit one of them and quickly helped Cole remove the collar while he was still tending for his bitten hand. Before the other man could get hold of them, Cole had been freed and he retreated. \n\"Dexter, you should know you have no right to imprison me in my house.\" Cole growled though  his pureblood had been temporarily tamed. \n\"I had to do that to make sure you didn't harm others in your... condition.\" Lord Dexter said. \nCole looked around. \n\"What are you all doing in my room? Get out!\" Cole said to the little crowd that had gathered there. \nSo there was only me, Cole, Rhea, their dad, Lord Dexter and Malcolm left in the room. \n\"In case you haven't been informed, Lord Woods and Valeria Woods have signed up a complaint against you.\" Lord Dexter said. \n\"Their complaint is invalid because their daughter is also involved\". Cole stated. \n\"Then don't forget to tell that to the court. First court hearing is three nights before the blood moon\". Lord Dexter said. \nBlood moon? What's blood moon? \nHow come I never heard of it before? \n\"Whatever. Leave my room\". Cole said to Lord Dexter. \n\"I will but remember, though you're pureblood, I'm still ranked higher than you. You should respect me\". Lord Dexter said. \n\"We'll see about that,\" Cole said. \"Leave now\". \nLord Dexter left. \nCole turned to look at their dad. \n\"Leave before I change my mind,\" He said. \nHe scrambled out of the room. \nCole rushed to Rhea. \n\"Are you okay?\" He asked, concerned. \n\"I guess,\" Rhea said and walked over to me. \n\"I'm sorry you had to see that\". She apologized. \n\"Nothing I haven't seen before\". I said reassuringly. \n\"Well, I'll leave now\". Rhea said. \n\"I'll see you later\". Cole told Rhea before she left. \n\"Malcolm, make sure the rumor doesn't spread.\" Cole ordered Malcolm. \n\"Okay but are you sure you're fine?\" Malcolm asked. \n\"I'm fine\". Cole replied. \n\"Then I'll leave now,\" And he left. \n\"Are you okay?\" Cole asked me. \n\"Honestly, I wouldn't like to see an occurrence like that again\". \n\"No promises though,\" \nI chuckled lightly. \nAt least the mood in here was lightened a bit. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people. \nThis update was kinda early though.

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nCole's POV \nDad and I always had this kind of tension between us since mom's death. He messed up again just when I decided to forget the past and move on. He admitted the fact that he freaking killed mom! Just because she was pureblood?! I felt like killing him too! I just didn't want to leave a scar in Britt's mind. I don't think she's ever seen a human being killed... Not to talk of a vampire. Killing a vampire was always brutal. \nWhat I also didn't expect was that Rhea was also pureblooded. I honestly would have prefered her being a normal vampire. Her being pureblood meant I had two people to protect. Living here was no child's play. Many dangers were attached. \nSomeone knocked on my door. I was in the office, by the way. \n\"Come in\". I said. \nI rubbed my eyes tiredly. I hadn't slept for days. \nMalcolm came in. \n\"Heyy\". He said. \" Boy! Do you look horrible!\"He exclaimed. \nI scoffed. \n\"Why're you here?\" I asked. \n\"Oh, you're grumpy too. Anyways, a case has been filed against you\". \nWell, I expected that. \n\"But the Woods have already filed up a complaint against me. What's the point in filing up another case?\" \n\"It wasn't the Woods who filed up the case, it was your dad\". He said. \nI didn't expect that. \n\"What did he say the problem was?\" I asked. \nHe cleared his throat. That got me more curious. \n\"Erm, he-\". He said. \n\"Just say it!\" I said, frustrated. \n\"He said you're um- having an affair with your pet\". \n\"What?!?\" I yelled. \nHow did he even know that?! \n\"Who told him?\" I asked after taking a deep breath. \n\"That's what I've been trying to investigate. I think your dad is up to something. But he's done a great job keeping it secret\". \n\"Brittany might be in danger\". I said, bothered. \n\"I'll ask a guard to watch over her while you're gone\".  He said. \n\"And where am I going?\" \n\"Lord Dexter requested to see you\". \n\"Now?\" \n\"As soon as you get the message, so yeah, now\". \n\"I changed my room code... So no one's able get in. But she'll be able to open it from inside in case a slave has to deliver her food. She should be safe\". I said. \n\"I'll meet you outside\". He said and left. \nI changed my T-shirt and joined Malcolm outside. \n~ \nLord Dexter's house was bustling as usual. Slaves busy with different chores... Half of the guards were chattering about... I guess they were the ones on duty. Some of the pets were taking care of a couple of really loud kids... So many activities going on. \nLord Dexter's assistant stood at the doorway, waiting to usher me in. \n\"This way please\". She said. \nAs an assitant, she had too little clothes on. \nShe was wearing a skin tight dress that accentuated her breasts and hips that have been surgically worked on. She added too much amount of lipstick on her pumped lips. Her fake blonde hair dangled down her waist. She wasn't there to assist, she was there to seduce. \nShe opened the door to Lord Dexter's office and left. \n\"Take your seat please\". Lord Dexter said. \n\"After you\". I said and took my seat after he sat down. \n\"You're probably wondering why I called you here\". He said and cleared his throat. \"Let's get straight to the point. Two heavy charges have been placed against you. How do you plan on dealing with it?\" \n\"To begin with, it's none of your business and why are you so interested in my business?\" \n\"Well, you know I'm in charge of both cases... I need to carry out some investigation before the first trial\". \n\"What? Who put you in charge of it?\" \n\"The head judge... Who else?\" \nI breathed slowly to calm myself down. \n\"Why exactly did you call me here?\" I asked. \n\"Aren't you curious about how we got to know about your affair with your pet?\" \n\"I'm not having an affair with my pet\". I said through gritted teeth. \n\"Oh, really? Then why do you care about her so much? The last time I checked, you killed all your previous pets. But you've protected her so well\". \n\"Just do your job and stop prying into stuff that you should totally put your nose out of\". \n\"This is part of my job. Tell me, why haven't you killed her?\" \n\"I never killed anyone in the first place\". \n\"What about the other two previous pets?\" \n\"I didn't kill them. You just placed a false allegation against me so quit saying that I killed them!\" I yelled. \nAgain, I breathed deeply to calm myself down. \n\"Let's not venture into that. If you have nothing else to say then I'm done here\". I said and stood up. \n\"See you at court, Prince Cole\". He said before I stepped out. \n~ \n\"What did he say?\" Malcolm asked me when I got to the car\". \n\"Stuff about my relationship with Britt. He is acting very suspicious. Could you do some private investigation and give me some feedback?\" \n\"Uh, sure\". He said. \n\"Be really careful\". \nHe rolled his eyes at me. \n\"I'm not Britt\". He teased. \n\"I think we'll soon run out of gas,\". I said, changing the subject. \n~ I was terribly tired by the time we got home but something seemed wrong. \nWhen I got to my office, the guard that was supposed to guard Britt and a female slave was standing by the door. \n\"What are you two doing here?\" I asked tiredly. \n\"Um, we have something to report, your majesty\". The guard said. \n\"Come in\". I offered. \nWe all walked into my office. \nThey had a not-so pleasant look on their faces. \n\"Sit down\". I offered. \n\"Uh, thank you sir but we'd rather stand\". The guard said. \n\"So what do you have to report?\" I asked. \nThey looked at each other, one waiting for the other to speak. \n\"You've been doing all the talking so speak\". I said to the guard. \n\"Um- B-\" The guard stuttered. \n\"I'm respecting you by not prying into your minds. Do yourself a favor by speaking clearly\". I said in a stern tone. \n\"Miss Brittany is missing\". He said. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nI'm terribly sorry for the super late update.

Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nBrittany's POV \nI hadn't seen Cole for days. He's been pretty busy, I guess. I felt like something was wrong. I just couldn't place a pin on it. Since Cole and Rhea's fight with their dad, everyone's been extra busy, except me. \nI just busied myself with writing more songs in my book, which was gradually getting boring to me. There was no doubt that I loved music but doing nothing but sleeping, eating, taking long baths and writing a couple of songs really bores someone out. \nSomeone knocked on the door. \n\"Who's there?\" \n\"Miss Brittany, I've been asked to guard your door. You can call me if you need anything\". Someone said. \n\"Okay\". I said. \n\"Um-\" I said. \n\"Yes?\" He answered \n\"Do you know where C- Prince Cole is?\" \n\"I have no idea where he is\". \n\"Oh, okay\". I said. \nI tucked myself under the duvet, ready to sleep, when another knock interrupted me. \n\"Who's there?\" I asked. \n\"It's me- M- miss Brittany\". The guard said. \nHe sounded panicked. \n\"Are you okay?\" I asked. \n\"Y- yes. I was told to deliver food to you\". He said. \n\"Okay. Leave it on the floor\". I said. \nI waited for sometime before unlocking the door to take the food. Malcolm had told me that my door was locked on the outside and I could only unlock it from inside. He also advised me to open the door only when it was very important. Food is very important, right? He then told me a code I needed to unlock the door. \nI opened the door to take the tray of food on the floor and closed the door. \n\"So long, old friend\". Someone said behind me, making me jump in fright. \n\"How did you get in?\" I asked. \n\"I walked here while you were busy picking up your tray\". He said, folding his arms. \nRight. He used his supernatural abilities to his advantage. \nIt was Adrian. \nFlashback** \nAfter Cole left, instructing me not to open the window, I couldn't help but feel curious. \nI wanted to see what was happening outside. What's the worse that could happen anyways? \nAlright, just a quick peek and I'll shut it back. \nI pulled the curtains apart and opened the window without giving it a second thought. If Cole ever knew I opened the window, I was definitely going to get punished. But I opened it... A few seconds passed yet nothing happened. I looked at the beautiful world outside. It felt good to feel the cool breeze on my face. \nMy blissful moment was interrupted by a whoosh. What just happened? \nI closed the window back, feeling a little bit guilty for disobeying Cole's orders but again, disobeying him also made me feel kind of good. It reminded me that I was the boss of myself. \nI spotted someone leaning on the wall at the far end of the room, making me jump in fright. \nCreepy. \n\"W- who are you?\" I stuttered in fear. \nThe figure emerged from the darkness, making his face more visible. \nIt was that blonde guy from before, the one at the dining room. \n\"I'm Adrian\". He said. \n\"H- how did you get in?\" I asked. \n\"You opened the window\". He stated. \n\"I don't see how you could have gotten in without me noticing\". \nOur room was a little bit high up. He couldn't have gotten in by climbing. I'd have noticed. \nHe raised a bottle with a blue- ish liquid in it. \n\"Got a little help\". He said. \n\"What's that?\" I asked. \n\"You ask too many questions\". He wrapped his fingers around my neck, raising me above the ground a bit, choking the breath out of me. \nOkay, that was a pretty unexpected mood change. \n\"What do you want?\" I choked out \n\"You\". He growled. He let go of my neck and flung me on the floor carelessly but somehow, I wasn't hurt. \nHe drew the curtains apart and opened the window. \n\"See you soon, Brittany\". He said and jumped down. \nWhat just happened? \n**End of flashback \nThat incident was probably the reason for the nightmare I had that night. \nHe said he wanted me and he was back to get me. \nOnly if I had been more careful and obedient. \n\"What do you want?\" I asked. \n\"I thought I said that the first time we talked. But someone else needs you more than I do\". He said, walking towards me while I took steps back. \nI looked back to see that I was between him and the wall. \nHe grabbed my neck tightly. \n\"You have two options. Follow me like a good little pet or I'll force you to\". He said and let go of my neck a bit. \n\"You'll have to try harder\". I spat. \nHe choked me again. \n\"I hate that attitude. You're leaving me with no choice. How about I tame you a bit?\" \nHe let go of my neck and pulled me by the hair, flinging me across the room. \nI felt the pain sear through me. \n\"What the hell did I do to you?\" I yelled. \n\"Nothing. I just think you're... interesting\". \nWell, what a fucking wrong choice of words!!! \nFlinging me across the room just because you think I'm interesting?!? \n\"Fuck you!\" I cursed. \n\"Sorry but I don't do pets\". He said, smirking before slapping me across the face. \n\"What was that for?\" I yelled. \n\"Your rudeness\". \nHe grabbed my hair again and flung me across the room. \nI groaned in pain, attempting to stand up. He kicked me with so much force, making me fall back down. My whole body was throbbing with pain. \nWhat did I ever do to him? \n\"As much as I'd have liked to make you suffer, my time here is limited\". He said and brought a syringe. \n\"I'll go with you. Just don't inject me\". He said. \n\"Don't worry, I won't- at least not till we get out of here. Put this on\". He said, throwing an oversized cloak at me. \nI quickly put it on. \nHe ruffled my hair so that it hid my face. He attached a collar to my neck and put a leash on it. He threw the hood over my head. \nThere was this voice telling me to scream for help or stab him with something. The knife in my tray would do. \nHowever, I ignored that voice and listened to the one that told me to comply. \nHe was about to inject me when I stopped him. \n\"You said you won't inject me now\". I said. \n\"Shut up\". He said slapping me across the face. \nHe injected the liquid into me. \n\"Just a little something to make you quiet\". He said. \nAfter a few seconds, I suddenly couldn't utter a word. My mouth felt dry and parched. I tried opening my mouth a bit but shut it back almost immediately because of the intense pain I felt. \nWhat the heck did he inject into me?! \nHe opened the door and dragged me by the leash. I saw the guard lying unconsciously on the floor. \nPoor guard. Cole would almost tear his limbs off if he finds out that I'm missing. \nLet's just hope someone will see through Adrian's tricks. \nUnfortunately, no one did. \nAdrian easily tricked the guards at the door into believing I was one of his pets. They couldn't see my face anyways. \nAfter we got outside, we walked a little further down till we got to a black sleek car. \nNow what? \n\"Sleep tight, Brittany\". Adrian said before injecting me again. \nIt only took a few minutes before I slowly began to lose consciousness. Before everything went black, I saw two suited men emerge from the car. Someone else walked up to my slumped body and threw me over his shoulder. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nHow'd you like this one? \nThis is a filler chapter to let you know Britt's side of the story. \nIt getting really exciting right? *squeals* \nSo... I just wanted to know... Who's been your favorite character so far? \n* Till next update \nDon't forget to vote, comment and fan. \nLove y'all\ud83d\ude18\u2764\ud83d\ude18 \n\n\n"

Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nCole's POV \nI slammed my hand on the table in anger. \n\"What do you mean?!?\" I yelled. \"You were given a job... just one fucking job and you messed it up!?\" \n\"I... I\" The guard stuttered. \n\"Speak clearly\". I said in a dangerously low tone. \n\"I- I was knocked out\". He said. \n\"Who knocked you out?\" I asked him, trying to calm myself down. Causing a scene wouldn't solve the problem. \n\"He didn't reveal his face\". He said shakily. \nI clenched my jaw, as well as my fists. \n\"Actually, I stumbled on his unconscious body when I came to serve miss Brittany's food... Her door was open and I found a tray of untouched food on the table\". The female slave said. \n\"I remember him forcing me to tell miss Brittany that I had to deliver her food so she could unlock the door\". The guard said. \nI exhaled calmly and said \"Okay, you can leave\". \nAfter they left, I picked up my phone and dialed Malcolm's number, asking him to come to my office... Well, more like ordering him. \n** \"What- how?\" Malcolm said, dumbfounded after I told him about Brittany's kidnap. He knew how important Brittany was to me. I was seconds away from losing it. But nothing was going to get solved if I didn't remain calm. \n\"We need to figure out who kidnapped her\". I said. \nMalcolm nodded in agreement. \n\"Question all the guards... Especially those that were supposed to guard the main entrance \". \n\"On it. But I have to tell you... Remain calm\". He said before leaving. \nI'll try. \nHe came back a few hours later. \n\"I've questioned them all\". He said. \"I have a suspect\" \nI looked up attentively, waiting for him to continue. \n\"Adrian. He left the building with one of his pets who was hideously dressed. Normally, he hardly puts on any clothes for his pets so...\" \nI clenched my fists. \n\"Any other person?\" I asked through gritted teeth. \n\"Not really... But there's someone I think may know about this\" \n\"Who?\" \n\"His male pet. Isn't it suspicious that he suddenly gets a male pet, not just an ordinary pet but one that he never takes blood from?\" He said. \n\"Call him in for questioning then\". I said. \n** After interrogating Nathan, Adrian's only male pet, I figured that he actually didn't know anything about Adrian kidnapping Britt but he gave out hints that he heard Adrian talking about it with someone. \nThat could only mean that someone else was behind Adrian kidnapping Brittany. \nI knew exactly who it was. \n** Brittany's POV \nI let out a cough as I slowly regained consciousness. The cough was due to how parched my throat was. It only took a split second before I realized I was tired down to a chair. \nWell, well... \nI didn't bother to struggle with the chains that tied my hands because struggling wasn't going to help, it was only going to make my hand hurt. \nMy gaze shifted towards the door as I heard footsteps approach. \nThe door creaked open. \nAbout four men in black walked in. \n\"I see... You're awake\". Adrian said. \n\"What the hell do you want from me?\" I growled. \nHe laughed. A type of laughter that was void of emotion. An empty and cheerless one. \n\"You'll find out soon enough\". He said, grabbing my chin roughly. \n\"You know, seeing your face makes me want to rip your body in half\". He said through gritted teeth. \nSo violent. \n\"What the hell did I do to you?\" I asked him. \n\"You did nothing. It's the fact that you're a Devereaux that makes me hate you so much\". He said, grabbing my chin roughly again before letting go. \n\"What's Devereaux?\" I asked, confusion written all over my face. \nHe chuckled darkly. \n\"Your last name\". He said, making me chuckle. \n\"Well, I think you've got the wrong person because last time I checked, my last name was Riele\". I said. \n\"That's your mom's last name\". He said. \n\"W- what... No!\" I stuttered. \n\"Well... Yeah\". He said. \"Since you seem so interested in knowing your family's past, how about I come back here for a little story time?\" \nI glared at him. I needed answers. I didn't even know who I was anymore at this point. First, my age and now a weird last name. \nBut what if he was lying? \nHe didn't seem like he was. \n\"Right now, someone else needs you\". He said. \"Is he here yet?\" He asked one of the bulky men. \n\"No, he's not picking up\". He replied in a gruff voice. \n\"Well, keep on dialing the fucking number till he picks up\". Adrian said. \nWell, cursing was actually irrelevant. \nHis attention was turned back to me. \n\"How about we have some fun while we wait?\". He said, giving me a dirty look that makes me want to punch his face till I was satisfied. \nThe way he stared at me made me cringe in disgust. I almost gagged. \nI mustered up enough courage to speak again. \n\"If you keep on staring at me like that, don't blame me for plucking out your eyes\". I threatened with a growl. \n\"Oh! I'm so scared I'm gonna pee on myself\". He mocked. \n\"That voice doesn't suit you. It makes me want to puke\". I told him. \n\"Oh, really? Which voice suits me more?\" He said, attempting to sound \"seductive\". \nI put a quote on seductive because he did not even sound close to that. \nThis guy was asking for a slap. \n\"That one doesn't suit you either\". I told him. \n\"Shut up already!\". He yelled. \nWoah! The way his mood suddenly changed though. \nHe gripped my shoulder roughly, making me squirm a little. He stared down at the last place I'd want him to stare at. Then his hands began to wander. \nNot being able to think of a solution, I spat on his face. \n\"Bitch!\" He growled and slapped me hard on the face. \nOuch! \nI bit down on my lips as tears began to form in my eyes. That slap stung. \nJust as I was about to react with another sentence that was definitely going to piss him of further, a voice interrupted. \n\"Adrian, I clearly told you not to touch her\". The voice said. \nOnce the figure came into view, my eyes widened. \n\"You?\" I squeaked. \n\"Yes, me\". He said. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nHope you liked that one. \nI know most of y'all can already guess who it is. \nWhy don't you hit the comment section and punch in your guesses! \nJust so you know, this chapter is totally unedited so I'm sorry for any errors in this chapter as well as the previous ones too.

Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nBrittany's POV \n\"You?\" I squeaked. \n\"Yes, me\". Lord Dexter said. \nI knew Cole didn't like him, he probably knew that too but why did I have to get involved in the business between two vampire lords? \nOr was it about me being a... What was it again... A Devereaux? \n\"I'm surprised you're still alive\". He said, moving closer to where I was sitting. \n\"What do you want?\" I gritted out. \n\"You\". He replied. \nOh, c'mon! That reply is overworking my brain. \nI batted my eyelashes at him. \n\"I never knew I was so important\". I said in utter confusion. \n\"But-\" I continued. \"Don't you think you're going to be in deep trouble if Cole finds out?\" \nHe gave a short laugh. \n\"Well, that's exactly what I want. You seem so confident in your little pureblood master\". He said. \nWait, what? \nMaybe this was the part where the evil villain starts blurting out his evil plan... \n\"You just have to sit here like the good little Devereaux you are till your master comes to get you\". He said, patting my back. \nIf he meant what I was thinking he meant then... Oh no! And why do they keep calling me a Devereaux? \n** Cole's POV \nI drove off as soon as my car purred to life. \nJudging by the speed at which I drove, it took me less than an hour to get there. \nI got down and slammed my car door. \nI spotted his barely dressed assistant as I got into the house. \n\"Where's he?\" I asked her. \n\"Who?\" She asked. \n\"Who else? Lord Dexter\". I hissed. \n\"Oh, he's not here\". She said. \nI was slowly losing patience and she was enjoying this conversation too much. \n\"I clearly asked you for where he was, not if he's here or not\". I said through my teeth. \n\"I can't disclose personal information\". She said, she took a few steps towards me, swaying her hips as she walked. \nWas that meant to be seductive? \nShe put her hands around my neck. \n\"Get your hands off me\". I growled in a low warning tone. \nShe put her hands down and rolled her eyes. \n\"And, you're coming with me\". I said and grabbed her wrist and pulled her along with me. \nJust as I had anticipated, the guards that were guarding the entrance stopped us. \n\"Lord Dexter's assistant can't go anywhere\". One of the two guards said. \nI stared at the guard whose beard had covered half his face. \n'Play along, your grandmother is at my house'. I threatened her through telepathy. \nHer eyes widened a little at the mention of her grandmother. \nThat right, I'm always two steps ahead. \n\"I have a meeting with him\". She said, smiling seductively at him. \nHe blinked at first then nodded at her and stepped aside. \n\"Get in\". I told her when we got to where my car was parked. \n~ \"Did you meet him?\" Malcolm asked me. \n\"No, but I brought her with me\". I said, pointing at the barely dressed lady beside me. \nHis mouth formed a perfect 'O' as his eyes skimmed through her exposed body. \n\"Let's go\". I said. \nI pushed open the large door. I closed the door behind us after we walked into the darkroom. \n\"Nana\". The little try-hard seductress said and attempted to rush over to where her grandmother was sitting. \nI almost laughed when her head hit the glass restricting us from getting to where the old woman was sitting. \nShe rubbed her forehead. \nMalcolm walked over to her. \n\"There's a sniper somewhere around here. If you tell a single lie, he is going to blow off your lovely grandmother's head\". Malcolm threatened. \n'You're such a smooth liar'.I told Malcolm through telepathy. \nThere was no sniper in here but his threat obviously affected the poor assistant. \n\"W- what do you want to know?\" She asked. \nI clapped my hands. \n\"It's simple\". I said. \"Tell me where your master hid my pet and what exactly his plan is\". \n\"I don't know what his plan is but I heard him talking to someone about going up to the mountains\". He said. \n\"The mountains\". I mused. \n\"She's staying here till Brittany is found \". I ordered Malcolm. \n\"Should I keep her in this room?\" He asked. \n\"No\". I said. \"Take her to the dungeon\". \n~ \n\"Slow down a little bit\". Malcolm complained. \n\"You're not taking your car?\" He asked after he finally caught up with me. \n\"Who says I'm not taking my car\". I said and smiled when I saw it... \n\"You're taking this?\" Malcolm asked in terror. \n\"Yup. It's still in good condition\". I said, tapping on the old car... My first car. \n\"I can't believe you still have this with you. Why are we even taking this?\". He asked. \n\"We're going to see an old friend. We don't want any of Dexter's minions spotting us now, do we?\" \nI got into the driver's side. \n\"Hop in\". I told Malcolm who was staring at the car in disgust. \nHe groaned and got into the passenger side. \nWe tucked in our seat belts before zooming off. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nWhat do you think of this chapter? \nWhat do you think about Lord Dexter? \nTill next update \nDon't forget to vote, comment and fan. \nLove y'all\ud83d\ude18\u2764\ud83d\ude18 \n\n\n"

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nCole's POV \nI pulled up in front of the very familiar house. \nHalf of me was reluctant to go in... I didn't know if she had forgiven me. \nHow was she going to react to me coming here? \n\"Wait a minute, here?\" Malcolm asked as he finally recognized the house. \nI sighed. \n\"Yeah\". I said. \"Let's go\". \nI pushed open the large oak door and stepped inside, memories of the past flooding my mind, consuming me with guilt. \nWhen I finally got to her room, I rapped my knuckles on the door. \n\"I'm coming!\" The very familiar voice said from inside. \n\"It's me\". I said. I heard soft footsteps approaching the door. \nA few seconds later, the door flung open. \nHer pale blue siren eyes, her brown hair that was always packed in a long ponytail was now stopping right below her collar bone, her skin was  fragrant with almond oil the way it used to be, she seemed to have gained some weight. She looked better. \n\"Come in\". She said. \n\"I'll wait outside\". Malcolm whispered, patting my shoulder. \n\"What are you doing here?\" She snapped. \n\"I know you're still mad at me but I really need your help\". I said. \n\"That didn't answer my question\". She said. \n\"I answered it. I need your help\". I said. \n\"Oh, you want to use me again?\" She said. \n\"No, Thana. I'm not the Cole you knew fifty years ago, okay? I had a lot going on and I just... I just thought I could let off some steam by... You know?\" I said. \nShe scoffed. \n\"You thought playing with my feelings was a joke?\" She asked. \n\"No, no, don't misquote me. I didn't think it was a joke. I know I shouldn't have led you on, I know I shouldn't have played with your feelings, I know I was wrong and... I apologise, okay?\" \n\"You still find it difficult to say sorry? Well, you're still the same\". She said. \n\"That's where you're wrong. I'm not the same.\" I said. \nNot wanting to drag the argument further, she changed the subject of discussion. \n\"So what exactly do you need my help with?\" She asked. \n\"My pet got kidnapped and... The only suspect is your dad\". I told her. \nAs expected, she didn't look surprised. \n\"Wow! Well, I'm not surprised\". She stated. \n\"I know\". I mumbled. \n\"So what do you want me to do?\" She asked. \n\"There are hints that he's hiding her somewhere in the mountains, we need to know where exactly he's hiding her and why...\" I explained. \n\"I'll help you\". She said. \nI sighed in relief but I was a bit shocked. I was expecting her to make it difficult for me. After all, I deserved it. I put her through a lot. \n\"I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for her and... I know his reason for kidnapping her\". She said. \nAt that statement, my curiosity was sparked. So she was already aware of Brittany  Maybe she wasn't as secluded as I thought she was. She seemed to know a lot more. \n\"And I also anticipated that he was going to kidnap her and probably kill her\". \nI growled at the last two words. \n\"No one touches her\". I growled. \n\"I know you like her but you should really calm down or things won't go the way we want them to\". \nI was taken aback by what she said. How did she even know that? The last time I saw her was fifty years ago! But again, she's Thana. \n\"W- who says I like her? I'm just concerned about my only pet\". I said, stuttering a little bit. \nWhy did I even bother denying it? \nShe rolled her eyes. \n\"I won't call that concern and though right now she's your only pet, you've had other pets in the past and you've never been this concerned about them\". She said. \nWell, that was a little bit true. But that didn't mean I didn't have the littlest bit of concern for them. \n\"Fine. You're right. I hope you can keep my secret safe\". I said. \nShe scoffed. \n\"It's not a secret anymore. Dad knows about your feelings for her too\". \nOkay, shit! \n\"So why would he want to kill her?\" I asked. \n\"Why else? She's a Devereaux- he's not going to sit and do nothing\". She said as I registered to her words. \nA Devereaux? But she smells so human! How? \n\"She's a Devereaux!? How can she smell so human when she's actually the descendant of a family with a rare bloodline which was said to be completely wiped out?\" I asked. \n\"I think the answer is quite obvious. A witch did the job\". She said. \n\"Why in the world would he even want to kill her? Her parents were very important to the vampire clan!\" I said. \nShe rolled her eyes. \n\"He killed her parents. He wanted to be the highest ranking lord. He successfully killed her parents even after they left to live their lives as normal people. Everything was planned. He first killed her mother. After many attempts, he killed her dad too. A day after he killed her dad, he found out that they had a daughter. That was when he made those demons deceive her. He didn't kill her, instead he made them sell her. What he didn't expect was that she was going to be your pet. After he found out that she was your pet, he tried to kill her through poisoning. Obviously that didn't work because no one even noticed- I'm parched \". She said and gulped down the glass of water that was on her table. \nI listened attentively as she continued. \n\"I found that he also wants you dead. By kidnapping her, he's killing two birds with one stone. You know the court wants you to take over his position as the highest ranking lord, right?\" She asked. \n\"Well, no?\" I said, still in shock at all the information I was getting. \n\"Well, yeah. That's why he made your dad file that case of your relationship with her. The court's still observing you... And apparently, that case can make them halt their plans\". \n\"Wow!\" I breathed. \n\"The fact is that he's so power hungry. He'd do anything to remain at the top. But that position belongs to Brittany\". She said. \n\"But why are you telling me all this? Aren't you supposed to protect your dad or something?\" I questioned. \n\"He's not my dad\". She grounded out. \nI knew they never saw eye to eye but it wasn't this bad. \n\"What do you mean?\" \n\"I'm adopted. He adopted me so that I could help with his dirty business. He said he never thought of me as his daughter. Not even once. To confirm that, he killed my boyfriend\". She said. \n\"A boyfriend?\" I asked. \nHer eyes began to water so I assumed that was a touchy subject for her. \n\"Yeah. I had a boyfriend after you... A fianc\u00e9 actually. I was supposed to get married to him. But Dexter killed him because I refused to help him fulfill his wishes of becoming the highest ranking lord for as long as he's still alive\". She said, wiping a stray tear off her cheek. \n\"I'm sorry\". I said quietly. \n\"Don't be\". She sniffed. \nThana rarely cried. He must have really hurt her. \n\"I discovered all his dirty secrets while trying to take my revenge on him without killing him now that you've come to me, I'm going to help you to take revenge for both myself and Brittany\". \nWell, that works for me! \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nHope you liked this one. \nLord Dexter has a lot of dirty secrets, don't you think? \nWe all know one thing for sure...

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nBrittany's POV \nThe door flung opened as one of the men dressed in black shoved a lady inside before locking the door, leaving me with the unfamiliar lady \nA fragile looking woman who was at least 5feet stared at me with bright blue eyes. She looked frightened. Her eyes held so much light in them, so much innocence, but she seemed broken. \nThose bastards! \nDespite how broken she looked, innocence still radiated off her. \n\"Hey\". I greeted her but she didn't reply, instead she coiled away. \nDexter had finally untied me from the chair but I was put in a room that was tightly secured. \nShe tucked stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. \n\"Brittany!\" Dexter's voice boomed from the stupid speaker that he had installed in the room alongside a camera. \n\"Meet Samantha. She's going to be taking care of you till your master finally decides to show up\". \nI scoffed. \n\"She looks so weak. Do you really think she can put up with me?\" I asked. \nI didn't want her to get involved in all this mess. I wasn't just gonna sit down and wait for Cole to come save me. Her being in charge of me was just gonna slow me down. \nYes, I was going to escape. Dexter was going to punish her if I escaped. \nI think that was exactly why he chose her to watch over me. He knew I wasn't going to let her get punished. \n\"I bet she can\". He said. A beep followed, signalling that the speaker had been disconnected. \nI had to come up with another plan. Fast. \nSomehow, I had to get Samantha to talk to me. Only then will I know if she's one of Dexter's devoted employees or she was just compelled to serve him. \n\"So huh, Samantha. You really have no reason to be scared of me, okay? Just talk to me like you would talk to your friends\". \n\"Never had friends\". She stated. \n\"Oh. Well, I can be your friend if you want\". \n\"That would not be necessary\". She said. \nWell, she didn't seem like the interactive type of person, let's try this another way. \n\"Since you don't wanna be friends, how about you entertain me?\". \n\"How?\" She asked. \n\"You know, back home, I used to watch tons of yoga videos but I actually never did yoga. How about we practice some yoga?\" I suggested. \n\"What is yoga?\" She asked. Confusion was written all over her face. \nI mentally face palmed. Who the hell doesn't know the word yoga? \n\"Never mind. I need to change my clothes. Can you please get me a tank top and a pair of jeans? With a denim jacket\". I requested. \n\"Okay. Stay here, please\". She said. \n\"It's not like I'm gonna run away or anything. Just get me the clothes\". I said, smiling. \nActually, I just needed to buy myself a little time so I could check out what I found in the tiny bathroom. \nThere was something beneath the old bathroom tiles. \nLuckily, there wasn't a camera in the bathroom. I'll just hope it's a secret passageway or something. \nI walked into the bathroom and pulled out the odd tile that those fools never noticed. There was a wooden floor underneath the tile. \nI needed a weapon that could make the wood break at a single hit. I heard the door slam, alerting me that Samantha was back. I put the odd tile back to its original position and walked out of the bathroom, into the room. \n\"These are the clothes you requested\". She said, handing them over to me. \n\"Thanks\". I said and put the clothes aside. \"Sorry to trouble you, Samantha, I need another pair of clothes. A t-shirt and a pair of jeans with a makeup kit\". \n\"Um, I don't want to seem like I'm prying but what do you need all these items for?\" She asked. \n\"I'm bored. I want to play dress up with you\". \nYeah, I just used the word dress up like a five- year old. \nShe looked at me in disbelief. \n\"I wasn't talking about that kind of dress up, okay?\" I said. \nShe nodded, obviously still not believing me. \nI needed the clothes. We both needed the clothes for the escape. The clothes I was provided with were too bare and I sure as hell didn't want to freeze outside. Samantha's clothes didn't seem warm either. \nI didn't return to the bathroom though. There was a camera in the room. I didn't want to arouse suspicion. \nI waited patiently for Samantha to return. When she finally got back, I told her to put the clothes aside. \n\"Now let's make you look better\". I said with a huge grin on my face. \n\"Go take a quick shower\". I told her. \nAfter she was done with her shower, I gave her a floral dress to put on. \nI began the long process of applying her makeup. I finally let her look at herself after I was done with her makeup. \nAs expected, she was speechless. I would say she looked gorgeous. Her blue eyes complimented her looks too. \n\"Thank you\". She whispered. \nI smiled. \n\"You're always welcome\". \nSamantha and I bonded quickly. I guess giving her a makeover worked. She was beginning to get a little bit confident in herself. It took a long time to mend a broken person, I understood that. \nI successfully broke through the wooden floor under the tiles. It had some sort of stairs underneath it. \nI didn't get the chance to check out the room underneath the stairs though. The chance to escape presented itself before I could do that. \nIn order to escape, I needed to do something that was going to divert the attention of whoever was watching us through the first camera. I just needed to wait patiently for that day to come. Till then, I was going to continue playing \"dress up\" with Samantha like a five-year old. \nThe day came. We heard gunshots outside. Very faint, since we were put in a room that was probably soundproof. \nJust in case someone was still watching us, I had back up. There were a couple of empty wooden boxes in the room. I mounted them on each other so I could reach far enough to spray a whole can of whipped cream on the camera. They should have known better than to serve me dessert with whipped cream. At least they fed me well. \nI quickly grabbed Samantha by her wrist and dragged her into the bathroom. \n\"What is this?\" She asked, staring at the huge dark hole beneath us. \nI lit up the torch that I got her to bring for me some days back so she could see the stairs and everything clearer. \n\"An escape route\". I said \n\"What the heck are you doing?\" She asked. \n\"Helping you escape a miserable life. Now get down there quickly\". I said and strapped a bag to my back. \nThe bag contained food, water, clothes and some other stuff that I had been gathering. \nAlthough still dumbfounded, she quickly climbed down the stairs. I followed quickly behind her and closed the tile now above us. \nSurprisingly there was a lock there. I quickly locked it and moved down the stairs. \nAfter a few minutes, my feet finally touched the ground. \n\"Where is this place?\" She whispered. \n\"I have no idea\". \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nHope you liked this chapter. \nPlease feel free to comment your thoughts. \nDon't forget to vote, share and fan!!! \nTill next update. \nLove y'all \ud83d\ude17\u2764\ud83d\ude17 \n*P.S.

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nBrittany's POV \n\"This place looks so beautiful under the dim lights\". Samantha said. \n\"So beautiful\". I whispered, totally awestruck. \nI mean how in the world could a place this beautiful be built under the shabby bathroom. \nI wondered if anyone else knew about this place. \n\"This place is really beautiful but we need more light. Let's find the switch\". I said to Samantha. \nAfter a few moments, Samantha found the switch. When the room was well lit, we had a better view of what it looked like. \nIt was a large room with a beautiful chandelier dangling down. The walls were decorated with expensive looking paintings. The floor appeared to be made of hardwood... exotic hardwood. \nThe room was literally empty but it had beautiful lights and paintings. The chandelier, it was beautiful that it made my eyes water... I'm serious. \n\"We're gonna get caught if we don't leave here now\". Samantha stated. \nI nodded. \n\"Let's find an exit or something\". I told her. \n\"I already did that while you were busy taking the whole place in\". She said. \nShe pulled at the doorknob. \n\"It's locked\". She said. \n\"I'll check for other doors\". I said. \nI joined Samantha at the locked door when I didn't find another door. \n\"They've probably found out that we're missing so we can't go back\". She said. \n\"I know\". \nAn idea popped up in my head. \nI closed my eyes in concentration as I tried to do the telepathy thingy I did with Cole at the party the other day, maybe he'll hear me. \nCole? Can you hear me? \nI was met with silence. Total silence. \nI sighed. I'm not giving up so soon. \n\"What are you doing?\" Samantha asked. \n\"Quiet\". I told her. \nCole? Are you there? \nI waited a few seconds. Still silence- \n'Brittany? Is it really you speaking?' \nI scoffed but I was relieved that he answered. \n'No, it's my twin. Of course, it's me'. \n'Where are you? I came to get you but I heard you went missing. It's taking everything in me not to tear everyone here apart' \nMy heart melted at his words but I didn't want him killing anybody. That was going to scare the hell out of me. \n'Don't kill anybody okay? I'm under the bathroom'. \nI told him, before realising how stupid it sounded. \n'Okay, I know that sounded stupid but I'm actually serious. Now that you're here, I'm going to come back up'. \nHe didn't reply. \n'Cole? What's wrong?' \nI felt a sudden sharp pain at the back of my head but I recovered almost immediately. \nOkay, what was that? \n\"What's wrong?\" Samantha asked, alarmed. \n\"I don't know. I just felt a sharp pain at the back of my head but I'm okay now\". \n\"Are you sure?\" She asked. \n\"Yeah\". \nShe shrugged. \n\"If you say so\". \n'Don't come up, Britt' \nCole's voice rang in my head. \nJudging by the way he sounded, it meant one thing. \nCole was in trouble. \nAnd I had to save him. \n* Cole's POV \nWe stood in front of the underground building which looked like a rock on the outside. \nThat was where she was hidden. \nI couldn't go in there with my emotions all around the place. Me talking about emotions was weird though. Before, the only thing I wanted to do was mess around. Before I met Brittany, I was always emotionless. The only that didn't make me seem that bad was my sense of humor. \n\"This place looks kinda bomb though\". Thana said. \n\"Not when they have Brittany in there\". I grounded out. \n\"Let's go snap some necks!\". Malcolm said. \nI breathed steadily and walked towards the main entrance of the so-called hideout. \nI effortlessly snapped the neck of the guards at the entrance in half. \nWe finished off the other guards that tried to attack us and went straight for the master planner. \nHe was there, standing at the end of the hallway with a smirk on his face. \nTrust me, I was going to wipe that off very soon. \n\"What a pleasant surprise, little Vasilios\". He said. \nI clenched my fists and grounded out. \n\"Call me that one more time and I'll rip out your throat\". I threatened. \n\"You know you can't. Why don't we talk somewhere else?\" He offered \n\"Oh, I'm going to do something worse than just talking if you don't bring her here to me now\". I threatened once more. \n\"I see you figured that out. I apologise for taking your property without informing you. Since you don't want to talk somewhere else, we'll just talk here\". He said while I continued glaring at him. \n\"I was thinking maybe we could do a transfer of pet ownership-\". He began. \nI suppressed a growl. \n\"After all, it's just a pet\". He said. \nWhat game was he playing? \n\"Not just a pet. My only pet and I'm declining your offer. I want to see her\". I stated. \nJust then, one of his minions walked up to him and whispered in his ear. \nFool. Did he forget the fact that we were all vampires? \n\"The girl has escaped\". The man said in Dexter's ear. \nDexter glanced at me. He knew I was listening. \n\"How about the slave?\" Dexter asked. \n\"She's gone too\". The man said. \n\"You can leave\". Dexter said to the man. \n\"I'm sure you heard what he told me. Your smartass pet has escaped\". He clarified. \n\"Why do you seem unfazed?\" I asked. \n\"Well, I am. A large percentage of people held captive here always try to escape\". He said. \"I'll be right back\". He said and left with a few men. \nJust then, I heard a voice. It sounded so much like Brittany's. \n'Cole? Can you hear me?' The voice said. \nMaybe I was just imagining. It's the result of me missing her voice so much. \n\"The fucker didn't even acknowledge my presence\". Thana said. \n\"Well, he didn't acknowledge mine too\". Malcolm said, mortified. \n\"That's not important\". I said. \nMalcolm let out a fake gasp. \n\"Excuse me?\" He squeaked. \nGet over yourself. \nI heard the voice again. \n'Cole, are you there?' \nOkay, I definitely heard something. \nBrittany was trying to talk to me! \n'Brittany, is it really you speaking?' \nI asked, just to be sure. \n'No, it's my twin. Of course, it's me'. She replied sarcastically. \nI've missed her so much. \n'Where are you? I came to get you but I heard you went missing. It's taking everything in me not to tear everyone here apart'. \nIt was the truth but I can't believe I just said that. \n'Don't kill anybody, okay? I'm under the bathroom'. \nDid she just say what I'm thinking she said? If she did, this definitely wasn't the time to joke. \n'I know that sounded stupid but I'm actually serious. Now that you're here, I'm going to come back up' \nI looked around and found out that Thana and Malcolm were gone. \nGuess I was too engrossed in my telepathy with Britt. But seriously, what the hell happened? \nThe back of my head collided with something metallic. Or will I say something metallic collided with my head? \nWhatever it was, it hurt. \nDexter stepped in front of me. \nI growled. \n\"What do you think you're doing?\" I asked through clenched teeth, as I felt energy seep away from me. \n\"Getting rid of a threat\". He said, smirking. \nI lunged forward in an attempt to attack him but I couldn't move. My body suddenly felt heavy. Really heavy. \nHe injected me. How the fuck did I not notice?! \nYeah, right. I was communicating with Brittany and got distracted. \n\"Fuck you\". I cursed. \n\"Sorry but I find female sex slaves more attractive\". He said, still smirking. \nI growled. \nConsciousness began to seep away from me. \nMy body collided with the hard floor. \nBrittany couldn't come up. It was a trap. He had everything planned! \nI should have known. \n'Don't come up, Britt'. \nI said, before surrendering to the world of unconsciousness. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nHope you liked this chapter as much as I did. \nQOTD: Which chapter's been your favourite so far? \nAaaand that will be all for now! \nDon't forget to vote, comment, fan and share. \nTill next update! \nLove y'all\ud83d\ude18\u2764\ud83d\ude18 \n\n\n"

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nBrittany's POV \n\"We can't leave\". I declared to Samantha. \nShe looked at me with a look that screamed, \"Seriously?!\" \n\"I know, I know. It's just- Something came up\". I said. \n\"Is it serious?\" She asked, sighing in defeat. \n\"Apparently, my master came to get me. I think he's in trouble\". I said. \n\"Wait, you're a pet?\" She asked. \nOkay, let's just say it skipped my mind to tell her that I was a pet. \n\"Yeah, sorry, I just- okay, I'm out of excuses. I'm sorry\". I said. \n\"You'll have to do better than that, young lady. But we have to think of a way to save your master... That is if you're sure he is in danger. Are you sure he's even here?\" She asked, looking at me in disbelieve. \n\"Yeah, there's this- he just spoke into my head and-\" \n\"Okay, okay. I believe you\". She said, even though her expression said the exact opposite. \n\"Do you have a plan?\" She asked. \nI shook my head. \n\"You know surrendering ourselves to them is going to make matters worse, right?\" She said. \n\"I know. How about we find a way to open the door then we find help?\" \n\"Well, we don't have a better option, do we?\" \nAfter spending about ten minutes trying to open the door, we finally succeeded. \nBut the path down there was pitch black. \n\"Um, we need some light here. I forgot to bring a torchlight\". I said. \nLuckily, we found a torchlight lying on the floor. Why was there a torch lying on the floor? Maybe we weren't the first people that have tried to escape this place. Luckily, the torch wasn't rechargeable. It needed batteries to function. \n\"Any luck finding the batteries?\" I asked Samantha. \n\"Not yet\". She said. \"I found a box-\" \nShe said, searching the wooden box in her hands. I waited in anticipation for feedback. \n\"Aaaand, it has batteries in it. Looks like someone used to live here\". She said, holding up the battery. \"It has a few things we could use\". \nPeople have definitely tried to escape through this place before. That means they were probably aware that this place existed. It made me wonder if those people survived or not. What happened to them? \nI shoved a lighter, some stuff from an abandoned first aid kit and some extra batteries into the bag strapped on my back. \nWe walked down the now fairly lighted hallway. \n\"I honestly didn't expect this hallway to be so-\" She said, searching for the right word to fit in the sentence. \n\"Dusty?\" I suggested. \n\"Yeah\". She said. \nThe hallway definitely didn't exceed my expectations. I expected more, considering how exotic the large room was. \n\"Definitely not what I expected\". Samantha said as if reading my mind. \n\"Get out of my mind!\" I said. \nWe both chuckled. After a long walk, we came by another door. \nAs soon as we stepped outside the door, we were graced with the smell of... trees? \nAnd then I realized... We were outside! We were finally outside!! \nI've never been happier to see trees! \n\"Okay... I'm glad we're out. So- what's next?\" Samantha asked. \n\"Next... We find help. I need to talk to Rhea\". I replied. \n\"Who's Rhea?\" \n\"Cole's twin\". \nBut how was I going to find her? \n** Cole's POV \nColdwater was dunked on me by one of the numerous bastards in the room. \n\"You could have woken me up in a nicer way, you know\". I groaned, trying to get comfortable on the wooden chair I'd been tied to. \n\"Nah, it's much more fun like this\". Dexter said, with a smirk plastered on his face. \nYou can smirk all you want now. I'm going to do much more than pouring cold water on you once I get out of here. \n\"You know you won't be able to hold me here for long\". I told him. \nHe rolled his eyes. \n\"Yes, I will-\" \nBefore he completed his sentence, I realized he brought up the conversation to distract me so one of his men could inject me. \n\"What's that?\" I asked. \n\"Just something that'll keep you weak for a couple of hours. Till your pet arrives\". \nMy body fell limp in a couple of minutes. Staying awake was useless because I couldn't even move so I lured myself to sleep. \nI only needed Brittany to stay safe. They knew where she was. She was just walking into their trap. \n** Thana's POV \nI glared at the bulky man that practically threw me into one of the cells in the dungeon. Malcolm was thrown into the cell beside. We were only separated by bars so we could still talk but not when there was a man that was three times my size and two times Malcolm's glaring at us. He locked the door and stood in front of us, still glaring. \nI reached into the inner pocket of my jacket and took out the only weapon those fools didn't take from me. \nMy chapstick. \nMalcolm gave me a questioning look, probably wondering what I was going to use a short stick made of lip balm for. \n\"Hey, what's that?\" The bulky man said, pointing at the chapstick in my hands. \nI rolled my eyes. \n\"What else? A chapstick\". I said. \nMalcolm facepalmed. \nIgnorant creatures. \n\"A chapstick-\" I said again. \"That can do this!\" \nI pressed the button under the chapstick, shooting a sedative right into his arm. \nThat's right, a chapstick loaded with sedatives. \nI came here prepared. \n\"Bitch\". He growled, reaching out to open the door. He opened the door and stalked in. He reached out to grab my hair. But the sedative had already weakened him. \nI let out a relieved sigh when I heard a thud on the floor. \nI smirked and took out the other keys from his pocket. \n\"Sleep tight\". I whispered, taking out his weapons. A gun and two small knives. \nI walked out and unlocked Malcolm's door. He still looked stunned. \n\"What? I prepared for the worst. Dexter is a cunning fox\". I said innocently with a shrug. \n\"Let's find Cole\". Malcolm said. \n\"I need my bag. It has more weapons\". I said. \nOur things were going to be kept somewhere far away from the dungeon and someone was probably going to be there, watching over the bags. They probably knew we were going to come for our bags after we tried to escape. \nWe walked out of the dungeon and found out our things were kept in lockers with codes. I checked around to see if anyone was there, guarding the locker. \nNone. \nThat was suspicious. Then I realized- \nIt was too easy. Our escape was too easy. \nThey knew we were going to get out. \n\"It's a trap\". I told Malcolm. \nI quickly broke the lock after disabling the alarm that was put on it. I took out my bag and handed Malcolm's weapons over to him. I quickly exchanged the gun I took from the bulky man with my own weapons and zipped up my bag. \n\"Quick! We need to get out of here\". I said, grabbing Malcolm's wrist. \nToo late. \nThey were already here. \n\"Someone wants to be the heroine so bad\". Dexter said in a sing-song manner. \nI put on a cold demeanor. The only emotion coursing through me at that moment was the hate I felt for him. \nI quickly looked around, taking note of the number of men with him. \nFour men. Two on each side. \nHe probably positioned two men outside, just in case him and the four men weren't able to stop us. Judging by how arrogant he was, he was probably ninety- eight percent sure he could take us down even without help from his men. The defense outside was going to be weak. \n\"Why don't we fight instead of engaging in a fruitless talk?\" I said coldly. \n\"Good idea\". He said. \nTypical Dexter. He would never back down from a good fight or any form of challenge. \nThe two men by his right side charged towards us. I quickly shot one of them in the leg. While the second one was still in a daze, I shot him in the leg too. They both fell limp on the floor. \nI didn't miss the shocked looks on their faces when they realised they weren't healing. \nI smirked. Of course, they couldn't heal, those bullets were covered in vervain. They were obviously going to die. \nThe other two charged towards us, trying a different approach. But I knew my timing too well. I shot one of them, Malcolm shot the other one. \n\"Looks like it's two against one\". Dexter said. \nI have waited for this moment for so long. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nHope you liked this chapter. \nThis is the first chapter with three POVs in it, did you like it? \nWhat do you think about Thana? \nAnyways, that's all for this chapter y'all! \nDon't forget to vote, comment and share. \nTill next update. \nLove y'all\ud83d\ude18\u2764\ud83d\ude18 \n~ PS: \nYay!

I wanted him to pay for everything he did to me. I wanted him to feel the pain he made me feel. \nI clenched my fist and was about to give a smart ass reply when another voice butted in. \n\"That'll make it three\". The voice said. I flipped my head in the direction of the very familiar voice. \nI found myself sighing in relief when I saw the guy that betrayed me... Fifty years ago. The person I was so in love with. \n\"I see, you managed to escape my men\". Dexter said. \nBut there was something about the way he looked, he wasn't surprised that Cole had escaped. He looked... Pleased. \nLike things were going according to plan. \nShit! I should have known! Of course, Dexter was a very cunning vampire. We weren't going defeat him easily. He had planned this for years. \nI noticed the way his eyes roamed the room... Calculating. He was getting very close to achieving his goal, I could see how satisfied he looked. \nI had to figure out what his actual plan was and I needed to do it real fast. \n''You're not attacking\". \nCole said in my head. \nI noticed they were all waiting for me to make a move. \nI needed to buy myself time to figure out Dexter's plan. \n\"How about we put all our weapons down and engage in hand-to-hand combat?\" I suggested. \nDexter smirked. Arrogance oozing out of him. \nNow it was my turn to smirk. \nYou see, there was something about me... I never showed anyone my full potential. Dexter knew I was very good with weapons but he didn't know how good I was at fighting. But he assumed I sucked at it because each time I fought in his presence, I always messed up. I always messed up because of the vile words he would throw at me each time I would try to engage in combat so he would at least tell me that he was proud of me. I used to be so desperate for his love. \nBefore I knew Dexter wasn't my real father, we weren't exactly close, we were the exact opposite. He always pressured me to be perfect in everything.  I managed to be the perfect daughter at other things, just like he wanted me to. But I was never good enough for him. I just couldn't deal with his bullshit during the combat classes I was forced to take because he was always there, tellng me to fight this way and not that way. It always got my head messed up. He gave up on trying to teach me how to fight after he saw that I wasn't making any progress. He didn't just give up on me, he made sure I felt terribly bad about the fact that I could not fight. He didn't care to ask for the reason behind my weakness when it came to combat. I made up my mind to learn how to fight. I did it! I learnt how to fight and he had no clue. I didn't want him to know anyway. He was just going to say vile things that would discourage me and dampen my spirit. \nCole attacked first. Throwing fatal punches at Dexter's stomach. The force of Cole's punch was clearly effective but not effective enough to bring Dexter down. \n\"Punches won't work for him.\". \nI told Malcolm and Cole in their heads. \nThey understood what I meant, we had to unleash the beasts in us. \nBut I had a feeling that it wasn't going to be a very good idea. I'd seen Dexter's beast unleash. Trust me when I say things always get bloody when his beast is unleashed. That thing could not be tamed. \nCole growled at him, baring his fangs at him, Malcolm did the same. \n\"Trust me, you don't want to go that route\". Dexter said. \nHe was right. We had to consider it well, one of us could get terribly hurt. \nIt was too late now. Malcolm's eyes turned crimson red as his body size increased to two times his normal size. Muscles ripping as his body size changed. He was now in his true Vampire form. We call it \"The Beast\" because our true forms are ruthless and almost impossible to tame, just like a wild beast. \n\"Your beast doesn't look that bad\". Dexter commented, earning a growl from Malcolm. \nI saw Cole hesitate as he clenched his fists. \nI put my hand over one of his clenched fists in an attempt to calm him down. \n\"We chose this route. We can't back down,\" I told them. \n\"I'm not backing down\". He said through clenched teeth. \nIt finally dawned on me. Cole couldn't unleash his beast at will, he had to be aggravated enough for his beast to be forced out because he was a pureblood. His was the most ruthless of them all. \nI sighed and allowed the feral side of me to be unleashed. I really needed it for this fight. \nLoud growls, muscles enhancing, baring of fangs, fingernails growing and I was finally there. I felt the presence of the feral side of me. I growled at Dexter. I hated him like shit, my feral side hated him even more. \nHe cocked his brows at Cole. \n\"You are not going to unleash your beast?\" He asked but something told me he knew the answer to that. \nI was getting impatient, as well as my beast. Eager to tear off his skin, I charged towards him, successfully tackling him down. \n\"Hmm, not bad\". Dexter said, smirking. \nIt happened so fast. One second, I was on top of him, ready to dig my claw like fingernails into him and the next minute, he was on top of me, baring his fangs at me, his eyes completely dilated. \n\"A reminder for you, Thana, you suck at combat\". He snarled as he dug his nails into my skin. \nI whimpered. Memories of what he made me go through just so I could be perfect enough to fit his scheme. Memories of how he killed my fiance. All the bad memories flooded through my head, affecting my beast as well. \n\"Thana!\" Cole yelled. \nI hadn't realized I had snapped my eyes shut till he called my name. Tears were flowing freely down my cheeks. Dexter was still on top of me, grinning in satisfaction. I let him get to me. I gave him what he wanted. \nI saw Cole blur over to where I was, tackled under Dexter. \nCole forced his nails out of my skin and clawed at Dexter's back, inflicting pain on him. Dexter roared out in pain, clarifying the fact that Cole's nails went deep. \nAs soon as he got off me, I attacked him. \nHe growled at me angrily and slashed his long nails across my left cheek. \nThere was no doubt that it was bleeding but I felt it heal soon enough. \nI watched Dexter stalk over to his next prey, Cole. \nHis beast was unleashing but it was not fully unleashed. The only signs that his beast was getting ready to unleash were his dilated eyes and his predatory steps. \nThe moment he got to Cole, he hurled him across the room. \nCole groaned at the impact. \nI charged forward once more but Dexter's reflexes were too fast. He grabbed my waist tightly, digging his long nails into my soft flesh as I was only putting on a black sleeveless cropped top. \n\n\n"

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nBrittany's POV \n* After making sure that Samantha was going to be safe, I rushed into Dexter's hideout with Rhea. I and Samantha found her and a few security men while we were trying to find a way to get back to Cole's house. She said had Cole told her to find him if he didn't return home in two days. \nThe guards were presently engaged in a battle with Dexter's hefty guards so Rhea and I could gain access into the building without being spotted. We encountered several other guards before and after we got into the building but Rhea defeated them easily since she was apparently a trained fighter while I just clutched onto a pepper spray on one hand and a silver knife on the other with a bag strapped on my back. \n\"Why do I have a feeling I've been here before?\" Rhea questioned. \n\"Maybe you have. But we need to focus on finding Cole and the others first\". I said. \n\"Cole's text says locker room\". Rhea said. \n\"He texted you?\" I questioned. \n\"Well... Yeah\". \nHow? \nI decided to keep the other questions I had to myself and focus on our goal. \n\"We need to find the locker room\". She said. \n\"I don't think he meant an actual locker room\". I said. \n\"So we need to find a room with lockers in it? That's still pretty much a locker room to me,\" She said, murmuring the last sentence to herself. \n\"We need to find where the items belonging to their captives are kept\". I replied. \n* We walked for a few minutes before Rhea pulled me into a small empty room that was about the size of a janitors closet. \n\"Okay, so why are we here?\" I asked in the most minimal voice I could muster. \n\"We have to change into these\". She replied. \n\"About ten steps away from here, the security is a bit heavy so I got us these,\" She said, bringing out a pile of clothes. \n\"And this\". \nShe pulled out a purse from the same bag she had pulled out the pile of clothes from. \n\"So... What are these for?\" I questioned. \nShe rolled her eyes and replied. \n\"Uniforms for disguise. And in this purse,\" She said, holding out the purse in her hands. \"I have identification cards and access cards. There are no cameras at this side of the building because this is the janitors' block so we won't be spotted\". \nWe both quickly changed into the disguise uniforms and clipped our fake identification cards to the front pockets. Then tucked in the access cards into one of the baggy pockets by the side. \nTrue to Rhea's suspicion, the security was extremely tight. But of course, we got through, thanks to the I.D and access cards. \n\"Hallway clean up\". Rhea told the security man who had a questioning look on his face. \n\"Okay, where are your access cards?\" \nWe showed him our access cards then he allowed us passage into the next hallway. \nAfter searching for a while, we found a room that looked suspicious. Instead of the heavy wooden doors use for other rooms, the door of this room was made of heavy metal. \nThere was a card reader beside it. Well, that was a problem. \n\"Whatever we're looking for needs to be in here\". I whispered to Rhea. \n\"I don't think so. This looks more like an escape exit to me. The main door wouldn't look so suspicious\". Rhea said. \n\"So... How do we get through?\" \n\"I might know someone who has all the keys and cards to every door in this building\". \n\"Who?\" I questioned. \nShe ignored my question and began to type furiously on her phone. \nThen paused for like eight seconds, while I waited for her to say something. \n\"He hid the card somewhere here\". Rhea said. \nI looked around and a spot quickly caught my attention. \nIt was a beautiful artwork that was hung on the wall. \nI ran my fingers over the intricate design. Seemed like a perfect place to hide the card. \nI studied the painting once more... Nothing. \nI looked around cautiously before dismounting the heavy painting carefully. \nI looked behind the frame which held the painting and found where the card was likely to be hidden. Of course, it was there. I quickly pulled it out and tucked it in my pocket before putting the painting back up. \n\"Found it!\" I announced. \n\"Great... Now wave it over the card reader\". \nAs soon as I waved the card over the card reader, I heard a little beep and just like that, the heavy metal door slowly opened up. \n\"Well, that was easy\". I exhaled. \nI looked around the room. There were two more doors and one of them was going to lead to the locker room. \n\"So- how about we try the door by the right first?\" Rhea asked. \n\"Yeah, sounds like a good plan\". I smiled. \nThe card reader didn't work for the door, but our verification cards did. \nAnd it led us right into the room! \nThey were all there! \nMy eyes fell on an injured Cole and Malcolm. Another lady who was still conscious but looked very weak. She was going to fall unconscious soon. \nMy eyes zeroed in on Dexter, a naked Dexter. \nEwww. \nHe was hurting them. All of them. His form was bigger than his normal form. \n\"Stop!\" I screamed. \n\"Ah! Just the person I wanted to see\". He said. \nBefore I could react, I heard a low growl behind me. It was Rhea. \nHer form was bigger. \nI thought only werewolves were able to morph into bigger creatures. I guess I was wrong. \nRhea charged towards Dexter furiously. \nI watched in horror as Dexter clawed her stomach and hurled her into the wall across the room. \n\"Seeing your friends get hurt because of you doesn't feel good, does it?\" He said, smirking at me. \nI bit my cheeks so hard that I drew some blood. \n\"Little Devereaux, your parents hid you well. So well that you matured into a beautiful eighteen-year-old before I could find and kill you. Your vampiric traits are dormant.. Works for me\". He said. \nHe walked towards me and grabbed my neck. \n\"You could have been useful but you are an obstacle. I have to get rid of you and them too\". He said. \n\n\n"

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nBrittany's POV \n\"He'll be okay\". Rhea said softly. \nI exhaled and nodded. I knew she was trying hard not to break down... She needed those soothing words more than I did. \nI couldn't have stood up any faster when I sighted the healer that was attending to Cole. \n\"What's the situation now?\" Rhea asked him. \nHe motioned for us to sit. \n\"Just tell us, is he going to survive?\" Rhea asked impatiently. \nThe healer sighed in defeat and spoke. \n\"It's a fifty-fifty chance. The silver hasn't gotten into his heart yet, due to his pureblood lineage... We still have time to drain all the silver in his body, that means we're going to have to drain all his blood and as you know, his blood can only be replaced by the same blood, which means we need another pureblood\". \n\"I'll do it\". Rhea said. \n\"Of course, you will. And that's where the dangerous part comes into the picture...\" He said, hesitating to continue. \n\"Speak\". I ordered. \n\"He's going to die after all his blood is drained... Immediately blood is transferred back into his body, the fight between his spirit and that of his pureblood will begin. This fight can either kill him or save him\". \n\"The fight between two forbidden souls\". Rhea whispered. \nI crouched down and buried my face in my hands. After I managed to bite back the sob that was threatening to force it's way out of my mouth, I stood back up. \n\"We shouldn't delay this further...\" I said. \nRhea grabbed my arm. \n\"What if it kills him?\" She asked. \nI sighed. \"At least we tried\". I said. \n\"Start the process now\". I ordered. \nThe healer nodded and went back inside the emergency room. \nAfter about one hour later, a slim female who I assumed was the healer's assistant, came to get Rhea. \n\"It's time for the blood transfusion, ma'am\". She said. \n\"Wait, how much blood are they gonna take from her?\" I asked. \n\"Just a little bit. Just so his body can heal\". She said. \nI nodded. \n\"I'll be right back\". Rhea said before disappearing into the room with the healer's assistant. \nI heard footsteps approach from behind me. I turned around to see the unfamiliar lady that had fought Dexter with Cole and Malcolm. She was beautiful. She had brown skin like Dexter's with a head full of beautiful curls. What attracted me were her light brown eyes. They spoke so many untold stories. \nShe smiled at me. \n\"Hey, Brittany\". She greeted. \nShe knew my name? \n\"Uh, hi\". I said. \n\"I'm Thana. I guess Cole never mentioned me to you\". She said. \"We used to date\". \n\"Oh,\" I said. \n\"Don't worry though, he played me\". She said, like it was nothing. \"But don't judge him, it wasn't his fault\". \n\"You're pretty\". I told her. \nShe smiled widely. \n\"Thanks\". She said. \nI didn't know her much, but her personality already screamed badass. \n\"Are you and Dexter...\" I asked. \n\"Nope. We're not related. I just found out though\". She said. \n\"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't-\" I apologized. \n\"It's okay. You didn't know and I wasn't that surprised when I found out\". She said with a shrug. \n\"Have you found your real parents?\" I asked. \n\"They're not in the vampire region... It would be to easy to spot them. They'd be in the human region\". She said. \"I'll start my search for them after Cole wakes up... But I have some business to take care of... Wanna help?\" \n\"Depends on what type of business you're talking about and... I don't wanna leave here till Cole wakes up\". I said, picking on my nails. \n\"I know how you feel but Cole isn't waking up today, the fight between two forbidden souls takes at least a week. Cole wouldn't want you to sit around and wait for him to wake up, he'll want you to take charge and that's exactly what you're going to do\". \nYeah, I heard Rhea say that but didn't bother to ask. \n\"Forbidden Souls?\" I asked. \n\"Purebloods are forbidden in the vampire region so both Cole's spirit and that of his pureblood are both forbidden\". She said. \n\"Oh,\" \n\"So, are you in or what?\" \n\"Let's go\". I said, smiling at her. \nI liked how we clicked. \n* I watched as Thana pushed the dungeon gates apart. \nI smirked. \nI knew we were there for Dexter. \n\"I'm not the only one that despises him, am I?\" She asked. \n\"Definitely not\". I said still smirking. \nI felt as Dangerous as ever. \nDexter wasn't going to know what hit him after we were done with him. \nThe dungeon was larger than I expected. Rhea had ordered the guards to put Dexter in the third torture unit. The worst torture unit in the building. \n\"I see you finally decided to visit your father\". He said to Thana as soon as we stepped into his cell. \n\"You're not and will never be my father\". Thana said through clenched teeth. \nI smirked at the sight in front of me. \n\"The guards did a good job\". I said, nodding in approval at Dexter's body, which was presently covered in blood, his own blood. \n\"I see the goody-two-shoes finally decided to get her hands dirty\". He said. \n\"I was never one, to begin with, I was just a... Work in progress\". I replied. \n\"Oh, Daughter, there was something I didn't tell you. I already killed your birth parents. It's a pity you didn't get to meet them, they were lovely people\". He said. \nThere was no trace of remorse in his words. \nThana punched Dexter square in the face. \nOuch, I felt that \n\"Fuck you!\" She seethed. \n\"For an amateur, your punch isn't that bad\". He said. \n\"Let's see how well you can stand electricity\". Thana said, walking to a machine that had many wires connected to it. \nShe typed the several buttons on the machine and the next thing I knew, Dexter was screaming. \nWe both stood there in silence, both enjoying the show. \n\"Why don't we visit someone else?\" Thana said after about thirty minutes of watching Dexter fidget and scream in pain. \n\"Who?\" \n\"You'll see\". She said, walking towards the exit. \nI didn't miss the smirk that played on her face. \nBoy, I think I'm gonna enjoy this. \n* \nWe walked into the torture room next to Dexter's. \n\"It's him... I should have guessed\". I said, studying the old vampire that was currently held in the claws of a torture machine. \n\"Dexter's loyal accomplice\". Thana said in a sing-song manner. \n\"He's part of it?\" I asked. \n\"Of course he is\". Thana said. \n\"I guess that's plus one torture candidate\". I said, smirking at the monster that called himself Cole's dad. \n\"You won't believe the fucker did everything he did all in the name of returning Dexter's act of \"kindness\". She said, air quoting the word kindness. \n\"Act of kindness?\" I questioned. \n\"Yeah, apparently, Dexter saved the teenage him so he thought killing his wife and attempting to kill children is returning an act of kindness\". She explained. \n\"Is he really that loyal?\" I asked, staring in astonishment. \n\"Trust me, this guy is more loyal than you think. He's a devil, just like Dexter\". \n\"Never liked him since the first day we met\". I said, remembering that day. \n\"Well, feeling's mutual. Never liked you either\". The old vampire said. \n\"Oh, I see you're still conscious\". I said. \n\"We need to fix that\". Thena said, nodding thoughtfully. \n\"Yeah\". I said and walked to the place where all the torture equipment were kept. \nThe normal me would have never touched an equipment for torture. But since I said that Latin word, I became tougher than ever. Maybe it was that presence that was in my head, it made me derive satisfaction from seeing my enemies in pain. \nI felt a dark presence in my head again. This time, I was ready to use it to my full advantage. \nI pulled out a metal belt and went back into the room where Thana and Cole's dad were in. \n\"Oh no, it has taken over again . This can't be good\". Thana murmured. \nI smirked at her before focusing on Cole's dad. \n\"Here's a gift for you\". I said to Cole's dad, with a voice that wasn't really mine. \nI rose my hand up so I could start hitting him with the metal belt, but Thana stopped me. \n\"Stop!\" She said, still holding my hand mid-air. \nThe dark presence in me grew stronger. I growled lowly at her. \n\"It's affecting you, we need to get you out of here\". She said. \n\"Cole's absence coupled with all the bad occurrences that's happened in here\". She replied. \"It's affecting you and your beast\". \nI rolled my eyes. \nOf course, I felt the negative energy around here, but all I wanted to do at that moment was torture his dad. He was part of the reason why Cole lying down there. \n\"Don't interfere\". I told her, losing my arm from her grip. \nI was about to hit him, but again, Rhea's alarmed voice stopped me. \n\"Brittany! Stop!\" She yelled. \n*** A/N: Hey Beautiful People! \nHope you enjoyed this chapter. \nThoughts on this chapter? \nHave a beautiful day/night \nDon't forget to vote, comment and share. \nTill next update \nLove y'all\ud83d\ude18\u2764\ud83d\ude18 \n\n\n"

He killed your mom as an act of returning Dexter's kind act?\" Thana explained to her. \n\"What kind act?\" Rhea asked. \n\"Well-\" Thana started but Rhea cut her off. \n\"No. Let him explain\". She said, glancing at her dad. \n\"Okay then\". Thana said with a shrug. \n\"What do you want to hear? How Dexter saved me from the monster I thought was my wife?\" Cole's dad said, earning a slap from Rhea. \n\"What did she mean by kind act?\" Rhea growled at him. \n\"Calm down, I was just getting to that\". He said, earning another growl from Rhea. \"It's a known fact that I and Rachel were still young vampires when we got married. You could say we were drunk in love but that love ceased, it ceased the day she tried to rip me apart. The first time her pureblood side surfaced. She didn't recognize me, Rachel didn't recognize me! All she wanted to do was rip my head off my body! The person I thought was the love of my life wanted to kill me. Thankfully, Dexter saved my ass that day... I had to repay the favor but the only thing he wanted was Rachel's life as well as that of her twins, of course, I had to do it. It's a pity I only got to kill Rachel\". He said. \nI noticed how his eyes shone whenever he mentioned Dexter's name. \nHe was loyal to death. How did no one ever notice before? \n\"Fuck you!\" Rhea yelled as she clawed at his skin. \n\"You're hot but you know I can't sleep with my daughter\". He said. \n\"You disgust me!\" She said. \nI could tell she was shattered by what she heard, but I also didn't miss the extreme hate in her tone. \n\"I'll promise you one thing. I'll kill you. But I've got business to deal with now\". She said. \nMaybe there's no need for me to get my hands dirty anymore. I thought, smirking. \n\"Britt, Thana, I need to talk to you\". She said, walking out. \n\"Brittany! You'll never be Cole's beloved! Dexter will make sure of that!\" He yelled as I locked up the gates of his cell. \n* \n\"So, what did you want to tell us?\" I asked immediately we got out of the dungeon. \n\"The fight has started. He needs you\". She said. \n\"What am I going to do exactly?\" I asked. \n\"Just talk to him. Your voice can help him win\". She explained. \n\"Okay...\" I said, happy that I was finally going to see Cole again. \n* I trailed quietly behind Rhea and Thana as they led me to the isolated room where Cole had been transferred to. \n\"Why did they transfer him?\" I asked. \n\"The fight can get violent\". Thana said with a shrug. \n\"Don't worry, though. He won't hurt you\". Rhea assured. \nI subconsciously thought about what their dad had said about Rachel hurting him. \n\"I know you're thinking about what he said about mom almost killing him\". Rhea said. \nI glanced up at her. \n\"I'm sorry, I-\" I said, breaking the eye contact. \n\"There's no need to apologize. I know how you feel. But Cole wouldn't hurt you. Mom was driven by her pureblood to kill dad because her pureblood perceived that his intentions were never good no matter how much he claimed to love her\". Rhea said. \"I know you Britt, and I know Cole's pure blood listens to you. You're the only one who can help him survive this\". \nI gulped. \n\"I'm going in\". I told Rhea and Thana. \n* I followed Rhea into the room that Cole was transferred to. He was put on a transparent-like bed which I assumed was ice. \n\"He was put on ice to keep him in a trance-like state so he doesn't wake up. Things could get messy if he wakes up when the fight isn't completed\". Rhea explained to me in a whisper as we approached Cole's unconscious body. \nI felt a tear roll down my cheek when I saw him up close. His chest was bare, showcasing the point where he had been stabbed. His body looked so pale and lifeless. All vampires were pale, but he looked paler than any vampire should. \nHe'll survive it. \nI kept chanting in my head. \nI took a seat beside him and looked at Rhea, asking for permission to touch him. \nShe nodded approvingly. \nI grabbed his hand gently, biting back a sob as I did. \n\"You'll be okay. You'll win this, Cole. Please just-\" My voice broke. \nI bit my lips, unable to keep talking. \nIt was getting difficult to not cry. Seeing Cole like that made me feel shattered. \n\"Cole... Please come back... For everyone... For me... Please\". I said. \n\"I know you'd like to show me places... Places I might never see if you don't wake up... I know you can do it... You're a fighter, you've always been. Not everyone can tolerate half of what you have... Cole, please, come back for me, okay?\" I continued. \nI kept up with encouraging Cole to win the fight with his pureblood for the next few days. \n\"You look horrible\". Rhea commented. \nI let out a short laugh. \n\"Well, Cole owes me a whole day dedicated to self care from the best professional out there\". I joked. \n\"But seriously, you have to shower and brush your teeth. I mean, I'm pretty sure Cole's gonna kiss you first after he wakes up. Imagine how embarrassing it'd be if he kisses you then says 'when was the last time you brushed?\". \nI let out another short laugh. \n\"Okay, I get it. I'll go now\". I said then looked back at Cole's unconscious body which still had this extremely pale color. \nI squeezed his hand softly and whispered \n\"I'll be back shortly, okay\". I said. \nRhea chuckled. \n\"You wouldn't realize how much you love someone till you're at the verge of losing them\". She said. \nI nodded thoughtfully. What she said made sense. \n\"I guess you're right. Very right\". I said. \nI let out a gasp when I saw Cole move through the side of my eyes. \nI studied him carefully and realized that he didn't actually move. Just mere hallucinations. It was normal, probably because the only thing he did in the past few days was mumble a few words. Apart from that, he didn't even move a finger. \n\"What's wrong?\" Rhea asked. \nI shook my head. \n\"Nothing. Thought I saw him move\". I said quietly. \nRhea hummed a response. \n\"Okay, let's go get you taken care of\". Rhea said with an accent, making me giggle slightly. \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nSo...

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nBrittany's POV \nI was putting on a clean pair of clothes when Rhea rushed into the room like she had just heard that everyone on earth had been ordered to move to Mars. She rushed into the room shouting my name at the top of her voice. \n\"Britt! Britt!\" She yelled. \n\"I'm here, sheesh\". I said, curious to know what got her all riled up. \n\"He- he...\" She said. \nI immediately knew she was referring to Cole. \n\"What happened to him?\" I asked, alarmed as I quickly put on a T-shirt. \n\"He's been calling your name, I think he's gonna open his eyes soon\". She said. \nWith a new surge of energy, I sped out of the room, ignoring the fact that my feet were bare and my hair was still dripping wet. \nImmediately I got to where Cole was, I collapsed beside him, gripping his hand tightly but still in the most gentle way I could muster. \nI realized he was stirring awake. He was still muttering my name so I responded. \n\"I'm here, Cole, I'm here\". I said, smiling as tears filled my eyes. \nWords couldn't describe the emotions that coursed through me when Cole suddenly woke up and pulled me close to him, hugging me tightly. \nHe used his hands to untangle my messy wet hair, making me chuckle. \n\"I missed you\". I whispered. \n\"Durh\". He said, making me chuckle again. His voice was very gruff, probably because he had been unconscious for so long. \n\"I think your victory over your pure blood added more... What's the word?\" I said, not knowing the right word to use. \n\"Skunk?\" He suggested. \n\"Yeah, something like that\". I agreed. \n\"I won't deny I'm feeling more in charge now that I can control that pure blood\". He said after we finally pulled away. \n\"You know, I heard your voice while I was battling my pureblood... I heard you all. It's part of the reasons why I'm awake now\". He said. \nI remained silent, too overjoyed to say anything. \n\"Cole!\" I heard Rhea squeal as she jumped into his already open arms in delight. \nRhea ruffled Cole's hair and said \n\"Don't you ever scare me like that again\". She said and wiped off a stray tear that was rolling down her cheek. \nCole grinned and ruffled her hair too. \nI noticed that Cole had stopped messing with Rhea. He was staring at the entrance of the room. He looked like he was at loss for words. \nHe was staring at Thana, who was resting lazily on the door. She rolled her eyes at his reaction. \n\"You're still here\". He stated after clearing his throat. \n\"Looks like I'm the only one who didn't get a hug\". She said, walking towards us. \nCole smiled at her and pulled her into a brief hug. \n\"I'm just surprised you didn't leave\". Cole said, after they broke the hug. \n\"I wasn't going to give up the chance of making that old bastard pay for everything he did\". She said. \n\"Oh, that's right. I owe you an apology. I'm so sorry for all you went through after I did what I did. Also, thank you. Thanks for everything, Thana. You've helped me a lot despite everything\". He said. \nThana chuckled nervously, clearly uncomfortable with Cole's apology and appreciation speech. \n\"Your apology sounds sincere enough\". She said, smiling at him. \n\"I'm really happy about the mood in here and everything but I think Dexter has a plan B that might ruin everything for us. I've been trying to figure out what he's up to and found a few things\". Thana spoke up. \nEveryone focused their attention on her, waiting eagerly for her to continue. \n\"We need to discuss this somewhere more... Private\". She said, looking around cautiously. \n\"Cole, you aren't feeling weak or anything like that, right?\" I asked. \n\"I'm feeling just fine\". He said, flashing me a smile that made my stomach flutter. \nWe all went back to Cole's room since its walls were soundproof. \nThana started talking about the information that she had gathered. \n\"I think he has about five men stationed in this house as workers... Those men are somewhere waiting for his next instruction. I think one of the five men is one of the men in charge of the dungeon wing where Dexter's been detained. There are ten men in charge of watching over that wing, five for each shift. Dismissing all of them wouldn't be a good idea because we've been short of men since the last confrontation with Dexter's men\". Thana explained. \nI gawked at her as she explained the information she had gathered while I had been sitting with Cole's unconscious body all day long. \n\"So you're saying that Dexter's still scheming his evil plan while in cell?\" Cole asked, bewildered. \n\"I've known this man my whole life. He isn't going to stop just because you have him detained in a dungeon. He's very crafty so he's always one step ahead\". Thana said. \n\"Oh, do you remember your dad saying something about Dexter making sure I don't become Cole's beloved?\" I asked Rhea. \nShe stayed silent for a moment trying to recall when he had said that. She finally nodded when it clicked. \n\"You becoming Cole's beloved means you climbing up the ladder of leadership all the way to the top which would be a nightmare for Dexter so he's trying to kill you\". Rhea mused. \n\"Why does he want to kill you all if I'm the one he's after?\" I questioned. \n\"Maybe because we all have wronged him one way or the other and the fact that we're aiding you is pretty much a good reason for him to be after our lives\". Thana said. \n\"What about the other four men? Do you know where they are assigned?\" Cole asked. \n\"I know one's a cook, another one is part of the workers dealing with delivery of parcels and stuff... I haven't found out where the other two were assigned to but I'm suspecting they were employed recently\". Thana said. \n\"Where is Malcolm?\" Cole asked. \n\"He's out on official duty\". Thana said. \n\"What official duty?\" Cole asked curiously. \nThana had been keeping Malcolm's location secretive for the past few days so we were all eager to hear her response. \n\"He knows about my secret investigation on Dexter's plan B so he's keeping an eye on Dexter and the other three men we discovered\". Thana explained. \n\"And how's he doing that?\" Cole questioned. \n\"Malcolm's smart, I'm sure he came up with something genius\". Thana said with a shrug. \n\"So what exactly is our next move?\" I asked. \nEveryone turned to look at Thana. \nShe just smirked and said \n\"Wait for Dexter to strike\". \n** A/N:  Hey beautiful people! \nI had a lot of things going on so I couldn't update... Anyway, I'm back so- \nI hope y'all liked this chapter. \nY'all didn't think I was just going to let Cole die like that, did you?\ud83d\ude0f \nThe next chapter I'll be posting will be the last chapter of MVL! Are y'all ready?! \nDon't forget to vote, comment and share! \nTill next update. \nLove y'all\ud83d\ude18\u2764\ud83d\ude18 \n\n\n"

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nBrittany's POV \nIt was already two weeks after Cole woke up. Still no action from Dexter. \nWe had already taken him to the high court for the first hearing, which didn't turn out so well so the judge decided on a second hearing, which was today. \nDexter didn't do anything during the first hearing. That only meant he knew we weren't going to be able to settle the case in just one hearing. He was probably going to carry out his plan today. This kept all of us on edge as we all sat nervously in the court room, waiting for the court precedings to start. \nWhen it finally started, perspiration began to gather on my forehead as I never let my eyes leave Dexter, calculating his every move. \nDexter on the other hand, seemed calm and collected. This scared the shit out of me. Especially when I noticed that he was trying to suppress a smirk. \nWhat was going on in that evil head of his? \nCole's dad was called out too. He didn't even hide the amusement on his face as he listened to all the allegations made against him. \nI also didn't hide the glare that was directed towards Cole's dad. I still couldn't believe I was actually scared of him when I first saw him. Now all I wanted to do was bash his head. \nI felt a strong pang of disappointment as the hearing ended with another postponement of judgement. \nI didn't miss the look of satisfaction on Dexter's face, he didn't even try to hide it. \nWhat game was he playing exactly? \nWhat if he already bribed the judge or something? \nI decided to tell Cole my thoughts later on. \nWe all left the court room with disappointment evident in our faces. \nI made eye contact with Cole's dad before he was taken away to the dungeon. He just smirked at me. \nWhat was that about? \n~ \nI joined the others in Thana's room after a long shower. \nI sat on Thana's bed, beside Rhea. \nApparently, I was the last to get there. \nJudging by the look on everyone's faces, they probably felt just as confused and annoyed as I was. \nI didn't waste time in telling them my mind. \n\"That judge has definitely been bribed!\". I exclaimed. \" This is the second time... I- I... What stupid game is he playing?!!\" \nI was so angry about the fact that we put in so much effort and nothing seemed to work. \n\"The motherfucker's always two steps ahead\". Thana mumbled. \n\"Not this time though\". Cole voiced out. \nWe all turned to look at him with questioning looks. \n\"I just spoke to Malcolm\". He said. \nOh, right. Malcolm wasn't here. \n\"He's with the lawyer. They have a witness and one more evidence against Dexter and my huh... father. He refused to tell me, though. But he sounded pretty positive that we're going to win this\". Cole said. \n\"What about Dexter's plan? We don't know what his plan is or when he's going to carry it out\". Rhea said. \n\"Trying to find out all that is pointless. We just have to be ready for anything\". Cole said. \nWe all nodded in agreement. \n~ \nSoon enough, it was the day of the next court hearing, which hopefully, would be the last. \nThis time, the hearing was scheduled for the evening, 6:30 pm, to be precise. \nI got dressed and went to Thana's room, which was where we all agreed to meet. \n\"Look, Brittany's here\". Malcolm said as I walked in quietly. \n\"Hey, Malcolm\". I greeted, smiling at him. This was the first time I was seeing him since Cole woke up from his unconscious state a few weeks ago. \n\"Hey, what's up?\" I whispered to Thana as I took a seat beside her. \n\"Nothing much. We didn't say important stuff since you weren't here\". She whispered back. \n\"Now that Brittany's here-\" Malcolm started, but got interrupted by Rhea. \n\"I'm sorry for interrupting but I just wanted to say... I feel really touched. You actually responded\". She said. \nWe all looked at each other with confusion evident on our faces. \n\"You all, including Cole, wore all black outfits, even though Cole said my suggestion was dumb\". She said, air quoting \"dumb\". \nCole rolled his eyes at her. \n\"I didn't respond to your stupid suggestion, I wore black because I love black\". He said. \n\"Yeah, yeah\". Rhea said, sticking out her tongue at him. \nBefore their bickering could go further, Malcom intervened. \n\"Stop bickering, we'll be going to the court in the next fifteen minutes\". He said. \n\"I gathered a few things, which we aren't going to be able to discuss since we have limited time. So I'll just summarize\". He said, then continued after making sure he got everyone's attention. \n\"So Dexter's plan will be executed today, during the court hearing. During the court precedings, quite a number of Dexter's men will barge in. Just before the judge decrees his final judgement. Their first target will be the judge, so I already asked for his protection to be doubled. Then they'll free Dexter and the King. Then of course, they'll target Brittany and use her as a bait for Cole. While some of them are taking care of Cole and Britt, some will handle Thana and Rhea and the rest will take care of the people who are trying to flee the court room\". Malcolm said. \nWow. \nI definitely didn't feel very great about being told that I was probably going to be dead in a few hours. Even though I knew that already. \n\"That's so... Comforting\". Thana said sarcastically. \nCole sighed and said, \"Now that we know what his targets are, we just have to position our security in the right places\". \nSomeone sniffled. \nIt was Rhea. She was crying. Rhea was actually crying. \nI walked over to her side and engulfed her in a hug. We stayed in that position till she was done with crying. \n\"I'm sorry... I messed up your shirt\". She apologized. \n\"It's okay\". I said, smiling at her. \n\"I just hate being told I'd be in a life-death situation in a couple of minutes\". She said. \n\"Me too. But we'll be fine\". I told her. \nShe nodded and smiled. \n\"Are you two done being emotional? We have leave now\". Cole said. \n\n\n"

Purebloods are considered the most dangerous vampire breeds. They possess three times a normal vampire's powers. Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nBrittany Devereaux's POV \nI stood in front of the full length mirror, admiring the dress Sonia and Chloe had picked out for me. It was gorgeous. But I didn't feel very excited about today's event. I didn't want it. I only wanted the realm to be ruled by an impartial person, someone who could be trusted by everyone. I didn't consider myself to be that person but apparently, almost everyone did. But I didn't want it. But I also didn't want to disappoint anyone. \nI reminisced my battle with Dexter, the battle that almost killed us, thanks to Dexter's evil backup plan. Four months ago, we could have been dead. But one thing kept us alive. \nFate. \nSamantha somehow managed to figure out what Dexter's real plan was and used it against him. Now Dexter was finally dead! \nEh, not actually dead, more like a living dead. \nAnd Cole's father, he was sent to a place that was really suitable for him. \nAfter studying him for two weeks, everyone decided that the man had a serious mental problem... And had also psychopathic traits. So we sent him to a mental asylum... One that was specially built for supernatural creatures. \nSonia silently walked into the room and surprised me with a hug. I hugged her back, relishing the comfort that her hug gave me. Soon enough, I started to cry. I felt my mascara running down my face, the make up that was caked on my face was melting down. \nStupid tears, now my makeup was ruined. I cried more. \nAfter crying for another three minutes, I finally stopped. \n\"Sorry,\" I croaked out. \"I ruined your... Uh, shoulder?\" \nSonia was wearing a strapless dress so my tears didn't ruin her clothing. \nI picked up a beige coloured handkerchief and wiped off the mascara colored tears on her shoulder. \nSonia chuckled a bit and said, \n\"You'll be fine Britt, you'll be the best queen this realm has ever had\". She said. \n\"I'm the first,\" I remind her. \nShe rolled her eyes. \n\"Whatever\". She said. \n\"Start wiping off your makeup, I'll get Chloe\". She says and leaves the room. \nI picked up the aloe vera wipes and started wiping off whatever makeup was left on my face while waiting for Sonia and Chloe. \nThey finally arrived and Chloe started applying my makeup. Again. \n~ It was finally time for my speech. Panic set in. \nCole squeezed my hand reassuringly. I smiled at him. \nHe looked really good in the tuxedo paired with the designer shoes and all. \n\"You look good too, mi amore\". He whispered in my ear. \nI felt my cheeks heat up as I tried to stop myself from punching his arm. He's been suffering lots of punches from me lately. \nInstead, I created a barrier in my mind, so he'd stop listening to my thoughts. \n\"Blocking me now, are we?\" He whispered. \nI ignored him, fighting the urge to roll my eyes. \nA few minutes later, my name was announced. I placed my hand in Cole's as he helped me to stand up. \nWith Cole by my side, we both stepped up the podium. \nI picked up the microphone, took a deep breath and began my speech. \nI started off by acknowledging everyone's presence and then said a few more things. I took a deep breath and announced, \n\"I know you all have high expectations but... I'm sorry, I can't take this responsibility\". I said. \nGasps erupted from the crowd and a few people began to murmur too. But they soon became quiet. \nI continued. \n\"I know most of you really want me as your leader, but I think there's someone who'd do a better job than me-\" \nThey began to whisper to themselves. \n\"Ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome your new king, Nicholas Vasilios!\" I announced. \nEverywhere was silent for the first five seconds, then a thunderous applaud followed. \nCole stood beside me, shock was still very evident on his face but he somehow managed to grab another mic and started addressing the crowd. \n\"I'm uh- Still in shock. I really appreciate the fact that you,\" He says, referring to me. \"-handed over your responsibility to me. Thanks a lot, Brittany\". \nThen he dropped the mic and rubbed his palms together. \n\"I don't think we need a mic. We all have enhanced hearing abilities\". He explained. \nAs he continued his speech, tears welled up my eyes. I was so proud of him. I knew he'd be a great king. \nI knew a few people were not happy with my choice, but none of them could speak up anyway. \nThey just had a hard time accepting Cole as their King, because he was a pureblood. \nThe darkness that came with being a pure blood was something that couldn't be changed, but Cole had a good heart despite all these. They just needed more time to realize this. \n\"Words can't describe the way I'm feeling right now. I feel so honored to be standing before you all as your king. But I'd be happier and would feel more honoured if a certain woman would stand here with me, as my queen-\" \nI froze. \nWhat was he doing?! \nI watched in awe as Cole got down on one knee with his crown on his head, holding out a beautiful silver crown that was placed on a small red cushion. \nSo many emotions welled up inside me as I listened to his next words. \n\"-The quote that says 'There's a woman behind every successful man' proves to be very correct today as you are the woman behind my success. We've been through a lot together. We overcame every obstacle we came across together. We are perfect for each other. Miss Brittany Devereaux, will you be my queen?\". \nDuring Cole's speech, I somehow found my way to where he was kneeling. \n\"Please get up, Cole. You're the king now\". I said to him, with glassy eyes. \n\"I need your reply, Britt. I can't rule this kingdom without you by my side\". He said. \n\"You already know my reply,\" I said. \n\"I want to hear it\". He insisted. \nI sighed softly. \n\"Yes\". I finally croaked out. \nWith a huge smile plastered on his face, he stood up and placed the crown on my head before pulling me into a tight embrace. \n\"I love you, Nicholas\". I whispered. \n\"My full name sounds way better when you say it. I love you\". He whispered back. \nAfter our little moment, Rhea mounted the podium and announced the beginning of the coronation party. \nCheers of excitement erupted from the crowd as they all moved to the main hall. Of course, there was enough to eat and drink. \nI proceeded to the main hall with my hand in Cole's- I mean, King Nicholas. \nAfter receiving lots of gifts from the guests, me and Cole retired to our new bedroom, located in the most exquisite quarter in the building. \nI didn't wait for the maids to help me take off my dress, instead I asked Cole, who gladly helped. \nI went to my dressing room and changed into my comfortable silk night wear. \nI walked into the bedroom. Cole was already there, waiting for me in bed. I gladly crawled into his arms, allowing him to cuddle me to sleep. We were probably going to be sprawled in different directions in the next few hours. \n~ \nStupid clock. \nStupid ticking sounds. \nStupid enhanced hearing. \nYeah, I couldn't sleep and my wedding party was going to start in a few hours. \nI stared at Cole, who was sleeping soundly with his mouth slightly opened. \nI crawled back to him, smiling as he instinctively wrapped his arms around me. \nI closed my eyes once again. \nThis time, a movie played in my pitch black vision. \nThe movie took me back to when I was sold to the Vampires, how I ended up in Cole's house, my moments with Cole, my battle with Dexter, the time we almost died, it showed me everything, even to the events that happened a few hours ago. \nA teardrop slid down my cheeks as I finally drifted to sleep. \nAll these events happened for a reason. \nAnd I'm here today, grateful that everything happened. \n*** \nA/N: \nLadies and Gentlemen, I present to you the epilogue you've all been waiting for! \nI hope you're satisfied with the ending though. \nI still can't believe I completed this book!! \nMaybe I'll add a little bonus chapter in Rhea's POV \ud83e\udd14 \nMy updates were very infrequent but you guys still stayed.

A tear drop slid down my cheek as he placed the crown on Brittany's head. \nCole used to be a very horrible and heartless person. I remember how we used to fight a lot when we were younger. I used to think there was no hope for him. Then Brittany came, she believed in him and brought out his good side. A side I never thought existed in him. \nHe was here today, wearing the biggest smile on his face. I was proud of him. \nWe all moved to the main hall where the party had already started. \nI made my way to the table that was already filled with varieties of snacks and picked up a plate, filling the plates with some snacks. \nFood wasn't a necessity for me but I was a little bit obsessed with human food. I loved the different flavors that hit my taste buds any time I put a snack in my mouth. \n\"Hey, Rhea\". An all too familiar voice said. \nI turned around to face the owner of the voice with a mouth filled with snacks. \nThen I felt my faint heartbeat increase as butterflies fluttered in my stomach. \nI developed feelings for him a few months ago and I haven't been able to do anything about it. \nIf someone told the younger me that I was going to eventually have feelings for someone, I'd laugh in that person's face. But look at me now, feeling butterflies in my stomach. \nI took my time and swallowed the snacks in my mouth before replying. \n\"Hi,\" I said, straightening my shoulders. \nHe laughed. \n\"Hi? Seriously?\" He said, still laughing. \nI rolled my eyes. \n\"What do you want?\" I asked. \nHe stopped laughing and stood straight. \nI could have sworn that his pale face flushed a little bit. \n\"Oh, yeah. I- uh, I saw you attacking these poor snacks and so I came here to rescue the snacks from you\". \nI raised an eyebrow. \n\"Seriously?\" I voiced out. \n\"Oh, yeah. That sounded stupid. I just wanted to ask if you'd dance with me. I mean, everyone's dancing and we both don't have dance partners...\" \n\"You talk a lot\". I stated. \nHe rubbed the back of his neck and grinned. \nHE WAS NERVOUS! \nIt took everything in me to keep up my composed posture. \n\"So... Will you dance with me?\" He asked, after a few seconds of silence. \n\"Sure. I don't have anyone to dance with anyway\". I said. \nHe grinned as I placed my hand in his. \nHe placed his other hand on my waist and guided me to the dance floor. \nI was going to slow dance with Malcolm! \n*** A/N: Hey beautiful people! \nWho expected that?\ud83d\ude0f \nThanks for reading the short bonus chapter. \nI'll be publishing a Q&A shortly \ud83d\ude42 \nStay tuned. \nLove y'all \ud83d\ude18\u2764\ud83d\ude18 \n\n\n"

Pureblo... \n#beloved #blood #brittany #cole #comingofage \nHey beautiful people. \nWelcome to the Q&A session. \n*** (princessbookwormi123) \nQuestion: What inspired you to make this book? How did you start this? Did you have a plot in mind or did you just go with the flow? \nReply: \nBefore I started this book, I had a little obsession with vampire books and decided to try writing one. Let's just say that my love for vampire books was my inspiration. \nI started this book when I was twelve and didn't have any plot in mind. I just wanted to write something about vampires since I enjoyed reading it. Then I started developing a plot after writing a few chapters. But each time I started writing a chapter, another idea would come up. So I decided to go with the flow. \n*** \nSomeone also said... \n'I needed the writer to clearly tell me if at all the pureblood would be able to conceive with his love' \n... \nWell, I never thought of them having children together. I just wanted Brittany to know who she really was and for her and Cole to have a beautiful relationship together. \nOf course, they can have children during the course of their relationship. You're free to imagine it that way. \nBut I'm not including that in the storyline:) \n*** \nAnother question: Is there going to be a sequel? \nReply: For now, I'm not writing a sequel. I just want the story to end there. \nBut if I feel like writing one in the future, I'll let you guys know. \nIf there's ever going to be a sequel, it's going to be super short. \nI'm not a fan of prolonged stories. \n*** My reply to the question about smut. \nI know some of you came here hoping for smut and all. Well, if you fall in that category but still read to the end... I hope you enjoyed the book without the smut:) \n*** \nI'm done with answering the questions. Y'all can add any other questions you have in the comment section. I'll answer them here (not in the comment section). \n*** \nI have a few questions for you guys too:) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, that's all. I'd really like it if you guys replied to the questions above in the comment section. I love communicating with y'all. \n*** One more thing... \nSome of y'all dislike Cole for the horrible things he did at the early parts of the novel... Rhea's POV should change your mind. But I'll still explain:) \nAt the beginning of the novel, Cole was everything a pureblood is supposed to be. Heartless, horrible personality and all. He was mainly controlled by his pureblood side. \nThen he saw how pure Brittany was. Being with Brittany everyday changed him and he tried his best to get rid of the control his pureblood had over him. \nMore of his good side came out gradually as he learnt how to control his horrible pureblood side. \nVillains can become good people too:) \nI hope the explanation changed your mind about Cole. \n*** Thanks a lot for reading guys. Don't forget to keep on sharing this book. \nI love you guys\ud83d\ude17\u2764\ud83d\ude17 \nBye for now, beautiful people\u2764\u2764\u2764 \n\n\n"

        "chapter_content": " Hey guys, \nThis is a story I have Quizilla and I'm posting it up on here. It's already finish and there already a sequel. Hope you guys are going to like it. \n---- \nThe music was loud, so were the college students. It always bugs me when Kayla would drag me to these things. I don't even do anything, all I do is sit down and just watch Kayla act stupid in front of everyone when she's drunk. \nI amazed she hasn't gotten pregnant yet. I know that sounds mean, but I'm not going to be fake, she can get very---how to put it---sexual when she gets drunk. But she always regrets it the next day. I even tire to talk to her, but nope, she wont listen when she's drunk. \nBut at the same time, I'm not her mother. But I do try and act like a real sister and get her out of these parties and go home. I love Kayla, but she just never uses her mind when she's drunk, cause right now, she wouldn't be dancing with some jackass that's in one of our class that she hates. \nTo tell you the truth, I hate parties, and the people that come here. All it is beer, some kind of chips, loud not even good music, and sex in a room that's empty. \nI laid my hand on the arm of the chair and sighed. I have to admit, I am pretty bored. God, I hate being bored. It's like, I would do anything to not be. I would even pouch some drunk person. But since I'm not crazy like that, I wont. \nThe song \"I like it\", by Enrique Iglesias and Pitbull was playing loud enough, I felt the floor vibrate. \nI looked around the room to find Kayla. But once I looked right near the kitchen door, I saw a guy. He looked---mysterious. He had jet black hair, hazel-green eyes, full lips, tall, and pale. He was leaning on the wall, arms crossed on his chest, and looking down at the ground. He looked like he was in a mood--a mad one. \nHe tilt his head up a little---looking at me. For some reason, I didn't look away, I just kept my eyes with his. It was like, my eyes were just glued there, like they couldn't move, even when I tired. He then tilt his head down and I could finally look away. \nI felt someone sit next to me, I gasp. I looked over to see it was Kayla, \"God, you scared me.\", I said. \n\"Sorry, babe...\", babe was out little nickname for each other, has bin since 5th grade. Yes, friends ever since 3rd grade. \"So, why don't you ever drink with me, I feel alone.\", she said, making a puppy dog look at me and bring up a can of beer in sight. \nI put my hand on top of the beer and started to lower it, \"Cause first: I don't like the taste of it. And second: I like having my head clean when I go back to the dorm.\", I said. \nShe sigh, \"No fun..\", she said, crossing her arms, \"Well anyways..\", she said, making a big smile, like she was about to rip her face off, \"Zeke Ryan wants to know if he can dance with you.\", she said, excited. Zeke Ryan, how could I explain him? Oh! One word: Man whore! \n\"No thanks.\", I said, putting my arm back on the arm of the chair arm. \n\"Come on Dorinda, he's a cutie and what I herd, amazing in bedroom.\", she said, breathing in and out, weirdly, but like excited way, when she said the last part. \nOkay first, she knows I don't do that. And second, virgin here. Yes, I'm not afraid to admit it. I'm very proud of myself, I made all the way to eighteen and didn't lose it yet. \nWell when I love someone, and I know he'll love me back is when I'll have sex. \n\n\n"

When he start to undress her, she is saved by a guy she has no idea is. She than tells him she 'owes him' for... \n#hurt #party #saved #story #texttospeech \n\"Please Kayla.\", I said to her, trying to get her to stop from going upstairs with some drunk loser, \"We should just go home. Even, your drunk, you'll regret it later.\", I told her. \n\"No I wont..\", she said, getting up from the couch, \"You can go home, but I'm going to stay here a little longer.\", she said, crossing her arms and walking back to the guy. \nGod, why can't her brain ever work when she freaking drunk? \nI got up from the couch and made my way to the door. One my way to the door, I saw the guy again. He was still in still in the same position, ht tilt his hand up a little again. His head fallowing my way I was walking. \nI then looked away and got to the door, I turned the knob and walked out. More people where outside, drinking as always. No surprised. \nI wonder why that guy was there. He wasn't even drinking or anything, he just stood there, doing nothing but look at the ground. \nI made my way to the dorm, it was only like ten minutes away. No biggy. \nI was only like five minute away from the dorms. I had my Ipod in my ears, playing \"Life after you\" by Daughtry. \nI made a short cut, which is going behind the school. It was always faster, sure I have to jump a fence, but it's easy. \nI'm going to guess Kayla going to get home from her drunk ass loser on her own. I always makes me worry about her, she makes me paranoid sometimes. \nI saw one of the guys from the party, behind the school, smoking, from what it smells, weed. \nI made my way past him, keeping quiet. I learn before it's not best to mess with anything when they drunk, like really drunk, and when they also getting high. \nFrom his face, he looked like Kyle and was it was Kyle. He's a nice guy from one of my classes. What's he doing smoking weed? I always took him as the kind of person that wouldn't and be against it. \n\"Hey Droinda.\", I heard him mumbling. He voice sounded horrible, like his mouth had been novocain \n\"Hi.\", I said, not even looking at him or stopping. \nI heard him start walking, \"Where you going. Lets talk.\", he said. God, he's wasted. \n\"No.\" I said quickly, \"I have to get back to my dorm.\", I said, starting to walk faster. \n\"You can spare me a minute..\", he said, I felt his hand go on my shoulder, turning my around, \"I just want to talk.\", he said. He breath smelt. It smells like he haven't brushed his teeth in a long time, mixed with beer. It was horrible. \nI took his hand off my shoulder, \"No.\", I said. \nI then felt my self being slammed into the wall of the school, \"Kyle!\", I yelled at him. \"What the hell?\", I said moving from it. Walking up to me and pushing him with both my hands. \nHe grabbed my wrist and pushed my back on the wall again, \"Come on Dorinda, I know we both like each other.\", \nWhoa! What? Like? What the fuck is he even talking about? Has he gone insane? I may like him as a friend or something, but no way as in that way. That's just insane. \n\"What the hell are you talking about?', I asked. He had his hands on my wrist. He brought his mouth to my neck. I couldn't move my legs since he places his knees hard against mine. His lips started to kiss my neck, \"Kyle, stop it! I'm serious.\", I said, trying to move my wrist out of his hands. \nI felt his lips move up to my face, trying to meet up with my lips, I moved my face to the right, \"Don't try and think you can get away from me.\", he said, between kissing my face. \n\"Kyle, please. Let me go, your hurting me.\", I said. I heard him chuckle. God, what's the hell wrong with this boy? He lowered my wrists to my sides. I could smell his breath more and more and it made me want to throw up. God, please don't let him do anything more stupid. \nI started to move my body, hoping my legs would move from his knees, but no luck. He is way stronger than me. \"Stop!\", I yelled. Kyle brought both of my hands together and held them both in one hand, he brought his free hand up and stop kissing my face to look at me. \nHe brought his fingers up to his lips, \"Shh, I'm not going to hurt you\", he said. He put his mouth back to my neck, his free hand going down my pants. \nMy heart starting race with panic. He isn't going to hurt me? What does he think he's doing now? \n\"Please let go of my hands.\", I said, hoping he will, but sadly, I have no luck, he had a good grip on my hands. \nHis hands started to up to my shirts and pulling it up, showing my stomach and a little of my bra. \"Stop!\", I yelled again. He brought he hand up to my mouth, covering it. \n\"Shut up!\", he yelled. \nHow much I want to pouch him, kill him, slowly and painfully. This couldn't be Kyle doing this, Kyle would never do this to me. He would never try and hurt me. He would always be the one to try and protect me. \nI tired to bite his hand, but couldn't. Damn small mouth. \nSuddenly, I felt Kyle being pushed away from me. I fell right on the ground on my butt. I looked over and, I saw Kyle held up against the wall by his neck. I couldn't really see the person holding him. \"Let go of me.\", Kyle said. \n\"No.\", I heard the guy say. He then punched Kyle in the face, pretty hard if you tell me. Enough to knock out someone for the night. I got up from the ground and held both my hands right at my chest. My heart pounding hard. \nI saw the guy starting to walk up to me. The street light showed who it was. It was the guy from the party! \n\n\n"

When he start to undress her, she is saved by a guy she has no idea is. She than tells him she 'owes him' for... \n#hurt #party #saved #story #texttospeech \nWhy'd he save me, more important--who is he? And how'd he find me? \nWe just stood there, what felt like hours. Why wasn't one of us talking? His hazel-green eyes now look grayish-green. He had a look of anger and madness, different from the party. \"Are you okay?\", he asked, his voice deep and strong. He put one of his hands in his pocket. I looked at his eyes, it looked like they were going back to hazel-green. \nI just nodded my head. I couldn't speak for some reason. I felt scared, but for some reason--nervous. \n\"Did he hurt you?\", he asked, with a caring voice, but mad also. \n\"No..\", I said while shaking my head back and froth. I wanted to ask who he was and why he did that. Was he fallowing me? Did he here me scream? \"Who are you?', I asked. \n\"Doesn't matter..\", he said, looking down at the ground. Why did he say 'doesn't matter'? It so does matter, he pretty mush just saved me. \n\"Okay..\", I said, not auguring with him. I started to hear a groaning sound. I looked behind What's-His-Name and saw Kyle starting to wake up. What's-His-Name turned only his head, I herd a growl coming--from him? \nWhat's-His-Name then turned around and walked over to him. He bent down on his knees, he's hands on top of his knees. \"Wow...\", he said, sounded surprised, \"No human could ever survive that.\", he said. It was true, from the punch, it looked pretty hard, like it could have killed him. \n\"Where am I?', I heard Kyle mumble. His hand was at his head. I then saw Kyle face looking straight up at What's-His-Name. \n\"Behind the school. You fell Kyle..\", What's-His-Name said, laughing, \"and hit your head pretty hard. Better get home before mom gets mad.\", he said. Kyle just nodded and got up and started to walk. \n\"Kyle?', I said confused as he walked past me with a blank look on his face. Their was no emotion to what he was feeling. Nothing. No pain or anything. His nose was sure bleeding though. I turned my attention back to What's-His-Name was standing in the same place he bent down at. I walked up to him, \"Uh, what was up with that?', I asked. \nHe shrugged his shoulders, \"Who knows, maybe he's to high.\", he joked. \n\"Okay...\", I said, making the 'y' long. \"So, I guess I owe you one?', I said, putting both my hands in my pockets. \n\"Well..\", he said, walking around me, which is a little creepy, \"I'm guessing, when someone helps someone here, they do have to owe he or she one.\", he said, stopping right in front me, his left hand on his chin. \n\"Yes..\", I said, \"So, anything in particular?', \n\"Umm...\", he said. He made a face, with his hand still at his chin, thinking hard and long. \"I'll think about it.\", he said, turning around and walking away. Okay, I don't even know this guy, how in the world would he even find me? We don't even know each others names. \"It's Lucas.\", I heard him say while walking. That was a little scary, knowing what I wanted to know. \nNext day... \nMe and Kayla was in coffee shop. She looked so hung over. Her eyes had dark bags, so she wore sun glass that whole day. Her body and hair smelt bad. So much like beer and sweat. She didn't want to get a shower since it is like four thirty and she came home at like ten o'clock and slept till three thirty. She didn't dress normal--she was wearing baggy sweat pants and a plan full black shirts. Her hair was behind her ears, making her look like a mess. \n\"God, I'm never drinking again.\", she said, putting her fingers at her temples, rubbing them. She always say that all the time. Mostly the day after drinking. But she always ends up with a beer in her hands when she gets to the party. \n\"Mh-mmm.\", I mumbled, while drinking a sip of my coffee. \n\"I'm serious this time Dorinda..\", she said, making her voice sound angry, \"And this morning, I can't believe I did stuff..\", she said, making a gagging sound, \"with him, it was so disgusting.\", she said. \n\"Well, I tired to talk you out of it..\", I said. \n\"But not hard enough..\", she said, cutting me off, \"You could have dragged my ass out of there and I could have been different today..\", she said. \n\"And that-- you would have gotten pissed at me when we got back and just left after I feel asleep.\", I said, cutting her off this time. \nShe didn't say anything, she just looked down at her coffee. I hate it when we do this. When we fight and it feels like one of us is doing something wrong. \n\"Sorry..\", she said, \"You are right..\", she said, taking off her sun glass, and pulling her hair away behind her ears. \"I'm so stupid when I drink, I know I am. It's like something controls me..\", \n\"It's called alcohol and beer.\", I reminded her. \n\"I know..\", her voice getting low, \"I promise this, we wont go to any parties in a long time.\", she said, bring her head up. Her eyes looked weak and tired. Dark bags under her eyes made them look so small. \"I promise.', she said. I don't know if I should really believe her, she has said she wouldn't drink anymore, and I know that's a lie. I don't know about this one. \n\"Okay..\", I said, so nothing else could make her head hurt more. She put back on her sunglasses and started to drink her coffee again. \n\n\n"

When he start to undress her, she is saved by a guy she has no idea is. She than tells him she 'owes him' for... \n#hurt #party #saved #story #texttospeech \nI was walking back to the dorms, Kayla went to her parents house for the night. She felt it would be good to spend one night with her parents and to gets a good night sleep. She never like sleeping in the dorms beds. And her old bed is like a five-hundred dollars bed. I can see why she would love it. \nFrom her looks, she needed some good sleep. Me and her made plans to go to the movie next week, instead of a party. Lets hope that'll happen. \nI walked up to my dorm. I pulled out my dorm key and went in. I dropped my keys on the dish that was right next to the door. I walked over to my room, went in, and sat on my bed. \nMy thoughts went to last night and to Lucas. I wonder why he was their at that single moment when hell broke loss. I never seen him around school ever before. Well, the school is pretty big, I guess I wouldn't have, from over like five hundred (Or probably even more) people come here, and he's probably in the higher levels. Okay, so maybe he does go here. \nAnd he must take some fighting class to punch Kyle that hard. I mean, I watch lots of fighting movie, even though their not really punching them, it looks pretty hard. And in High School, I only saw few fights. \nMy mind actually been mostly on him all day. His face, never lift my head. It seems like his face was unable to forget. His jet black hair, covering his right eye a little and almost hitting at his shoulders.. How it looks somewhat almost shaggy, but straighten. And his eyes, it what mostly got me. How green they look, and the hazel you can also see in them. Everything about him, it can be unforgettable. \nI looked down at my watch, it was about eight. I got up and took off my jacket, it landed right on the floor. I didn't brother to even pick it up. I picked up the towel that was hanging at the end of my bed and went over to the bathroom. \nI open the bathroom door, I turned on the light. The light brighten the room, it hurt my eyes a little. The walls where white, the floor was tiles in white and blue. The small window, the curtain were a light blue. So mostly ever was white and blue, which made the bathroom look so bright, it could hurt you eyes. \nI walked over to the shower and turned it on. I laid my hand under the water, it started out cold, then began to get warm, then hot. I moved my hand when it got to the right temperature I like of hot water. \nI striped from my cloths and got in. \nI turned the knob to the left when I was finished and the water shut off. I pulled all my hair in my hands at the roots and went down. I heard the water from my hair crash on the shower floor. I pushed the shower curtains to one side and got out and wrapped myself in the towel. \nI walked over to the mirror and with the palm of my hand, I wiped a big circle on the mirror from the fog (Which was really just the steam from the hot shower, I just like calling it fog) and looked at my self. My wet hair was laying on left side of my shoulders. \nI walked away from the mirror and turned the knob and open it. I felt cold air hit my body more and more as I opened it. Goosebumps went down my back from it being cold. I walked over to my room. When I went in, it felt more colder than the living room. I tired my best to ignored it and walked over to my closet. \nI pulled out a pair of black pj shorts and a red tanks top. \nI turned around and dropped my cloths when I saw someone standing window. \"Lucas?\", I almost yelled. He was leaning on my wall next to my window. I pulled my towel closer to my body. \"What the hell?\", I yelled this time, bending down to pick up my cloths. \nHe moved from the wall and walked over to me, \"Wanna keep you voice down.\", he said. I knew it wasn't a question. My voice! He's more worried on my voice level than him sneaking in my room. What kind of person just sneaks in someone room like that? \n\"Ugh..\", I said, lowering my voice, \"Want in the hell are doing in my room.\", I said, trying to keep my voice down. \n\"You said you owe me one, I know what I want.\", he said. Oh god! I am not that kind of girl! I am not sleeping with him! Lucas grew a smirk on his face, \"I don't want sex from you.\", he said. \nWhat the hell! How'd he know what I was thinking? \"Uh, okay..\", I said confused, \"Well whatever it is, couldn't it have waited till I got dressed?\", I asked. \nHis smirk grew, \"You right..\", he said, \"My bad, I thought you would change in the bathroom\". He walked over to my door and walked out. I just stood there. My room felt a little warmer now. Weird. \nI walked over to my dresser and grabbed out a bra and underwear. I walked over to my bed and dropped my towel and got dressed. \nI didn't want to go out in the living room. For some reason, I felt nervous and scared. Even, wouldn't you find it weird if you find someone you don't even know but his name in your room? How'd he get in my house? That just scared me ever more about him. \nBut I guess I have to do it. I don't want him in my living room all night. I walked over to my door and walked out, closing it behind me. \nI walked into my living room and saw Lucas sitting on the couch. He looked over at me and smiled. Jeez, his smile is so cute. \nShut up! Shut up! Shut up! \n\"Do you want anything to drink?\", I asked. \nHe shook his head, \"No, I'm good.\", he said. \nI walked other to the couch that was opposite of where he was sitting. It now felt colder in here. \"So, what do you want.\", I asked nicely. \n\"First your name.\", he said. Wow, what a waste of time. \n\"Dorinda.\", \n\"Wow, lovely name.\", he said. I blushed when he said that. \n\"Thanks.\", I said, moving one side of my hair behind my ears. \n\"Okay, here's what I want. But it starts off with a question.\", he said. I raised my eyebrows. A question? \n\"Okay.\", I said. \n\"Do you believe in vampires?\". Vampires? That's an odd question. \n\"Like vampires as in fangs and blood?\" I asked, feeling the need to laugh a little. I crossed my arms over my chest and slugged down in the couch. \nHe nodded his head, \"Yes, as in fangs and blood. But do you believe in them?', he asked. \n\"Uh..\", I said, chuckling, \"No.\", I said. The smirk on my face somehow wouldn't go away. \n\"And why not.\", he asked. \n\"Cause vampires aren't real.\" \n\"Yes they are.\", \n\"No they are not.\", I said. What's up with this guy? Is he crazy or something? \n\"No I haven't..\", he said, his voice sounded icy and cold a little. \"Their real, I should know..\", he said getting up from the couch. \"I would know since I am one and I'm there prince.\". \nMy eyes winded. Not because he said he's a vampire, which I know he isn't. because how scary and how angry he can get in seconds. My smirk went away and I pulled my knees up to my chest and wrapped my arms around my legs. \n\"Okay.\", I said, still not believe him, but I didn't want to make him even more angrier. \n\"Your not believing me..\". Damn, how'd know that? \"I know cause I can read minds. I am.\", he said. \"If I wasn't a vampire, would I have these.\", he said, opening his mouth and to sharp fangs came out. I eyes felt like they almost popped out my head and my loos went cold. \"Or do this.\", he said, over to the wall in lighten speed. How'd he get over there? He then punched the walls that didn't even looked like a hard punch, but made a large hole in it. \nI got up from the couch and ran to him and laid my hand on his arm so he wouldn't do it again, \"Okay, I believe you.\", I said, my heart racing even fast, \"But I still live here, how in the hell am I going to explain this.\", I said, pointing at the hole. \nHe than started laughing. Why in the hell is he laughing? \"Because you wont be living here anymore.\", he said. Showing his large white fangs. \n\"Huh?\", I asked raising my eyebrows again. \n\"What I want from you is to be my slave.\", he said. \nMy eyebrows lowered and I took my arm off of his and started to walked backwards. His eyes were fallowing me. I turned around quickly and started running to my bedroom. But when I got to my door, Lucas was already a front of me. \n\"No use in running. I'm many times faster then you.\", he said, his voice was icy and sharp again. \n\n\n"

Great, she's going be pissed. \n\"I don't want to hurt you but you'll have to come with me.\", he said, grabbing my arm. His hand was freezing cold.. It sent shivers up my arm to my neck. \n\"What..\", I said, scared, \"I'm not going anywhere.\", I said, trying to get his hand off, but he just tighten up his hand, which felt like he was going to break it. \"Not with you.\", I hissed at him. \nI then saw his eyes turn grayish-green. He than just looked at me, not even blinking, his eyes were just on mine eyes. I just stood their, eye blinking, shaking, getting more scared. He then starting blinking, \"Why didn't it work.\", he said to himself. Work? What in the hell is he talking about. \"Why can't I glamour you?\", he asked. \nGlamour, as in control me? God, he can do that? \n\"Forget it.\", he said. I saw his arm raised and hit me in the face, knocking me out. \n* \nMy eyes started to filter open. I could see over my eyelashes. I could see a dim light coming from something that was hovering over top of me. My breathing seem normal from what I could hear. Pain hit my head so fast though. \nI started opening up my eyes more. I could see the light more but it was still dim. I could feel my body perfectly \nMy eyes were fully open now, not blurry, but around my eyes hurt a lot. Like a giant headache. But I mostly only get them on my left side, like I been hit in the face. I looked around the room. I saw it was a normal white wall room. It had to dresser. A medium size tv. \nI got up from the bed and stretched my body. The room temperature felt a little cold. I rubbed my eyes and sighed. \"Where am I?\", I mummbled to myself. I looked around again and saw their was another bed like I was laying on. But that one had purple blankets and a blue pillow. The bed I was sleeping on only had a pillow on it. \nThe carpet on the floor was a white carpet that look liked it had a tint of blue in it. I only saw one medium size window. \nIt had white currents. I went over and looked out of it. I gasped. Outside it looked a little foggy, but you could still see that where somewhere in a forest. The sky was grayish, like on a rainy day, but you could see the blue, but what was weird, it had a tint of purple in it. \nPurple? I never seen clouds with purple. Yes, maybe when the sun site sometimes, but it seems like it's the afternoon. Bits and pieces starting coming back and I started to panic. \nI then heard the door being on so I turned around feel fast. I saw a girl with light beautiful blond hair that went down to the middle of her back. She had perfect skin tone. It looked so light and soft. Perfectly thin, but a little full shape lips. Beautiful blue eyes. She wore what looked like old ripped blue jeans with a black tank top. \nOn her both arms what looked like just like a tattoo, what light blue ocean waves that went from her fingers, all the way up to her neck. It made her light skin make her more beautiful. \nShe was carrying a blue blanket and a blue pillow case. \nShe then made her attention to me and smiled, \"Hi.\", she said, showing off her perfect white teeth, \"Your finally awake. Thank goodness.\", she said walking over to the bed I was laying on and grabbing the pillow and putting the pillow into the pillow case, \"Master Lucas was wondering when you'll wake up,\" she said little out quick giggle, \"he didn't know he hit you that hard.\", she said, laying the down pillow and spreading out the blanket. \nShe then clapped her hands and ran over to me, \"I'm Jasmine-May, but you can call me Jasmine .\", she said, holding out her hands. \n\"Uh..\", I said, not sure to take her hand. And Master Lucas? What the heck? And he hit me!? \n\"I'm not going to hurt you Silly Billy.\", she said taking a quick giggle again. \"I'm not a vampire.\", she said. \nThat wasn't what I worried about though. I reached my hand out and took it in hers, \"Dorinda.\", I said. \n\"I know.\" she said breathing in and out happily for some reason, \"Master told me.\". What's with her and saying Master Lucas? \"Oh goodness me.\", she said slapping her head, \"You must be wondering where you are. I mean, you are the only other human in this palace.\", she said. \nPalace? And what in the hell did she mean by other human. Isn't she a human? \"Uh..\", I said again, not really sure what to say. \"Where am I?', I asked, a little to hard without me meaning to. \nHer smiled went away, \"I guess I should have told you that first. Welcome to The Shadow Coven.\". Shadow Coven? I very much don't believe that's a place in the world. But what do I know, I didn't really pay much attention in Social Studies? \"It's in another world--dimension.\", she said. \nI didn't say anything, but my mouth opened a little. I could real my heart racing a little. Another world? Dimension? This can't be real? My parents are probably going nuts on where I am. This has to be a joke. Or a dream. Yes, I must be dreaming. \n\"W-What?\", I asked. \"You joking right. This has to be a dream.\", I said crossing my arms on my chest stubbornly, but I was really panicking inside. \n\"No, you're not Dorinda. This world is very much real and your not dreaming. Want me to prove it?\", she said, punching my arm. \n\"Ow.\", I said. Damn, she looks weak, but she's not. \n\"See. And in this world, theres not very many humans. This world is filled with vampires.\". I thought she said she wasn't a vampire. What in the hell is she then? I raised my eyebrows in confusion, \"Oh silly me.\", she said again, \"I'm a pixie, or you can say fairy. Their mostly just the same thing.\", she said. \n\n\n"

        "chapter_content": " YOU ARE READING \nWhen Dorinda Bennett was walking home from a college party that her best friend, Kayla, dragged her to, she get harrassed by a school mate. When he start to undress her, she is saved by a guy she has no idea is. She than tells him she 'owes him' for... \n#hurt #party #saved #story #texttospeech \nHow could this all be real? Why do bad things have to happen to me? I'm a good person. I do good things for people. Why me though? I can't believe Lucas made me his slave! I don't even know Lucas! I can't believe I told him I owe him one. I should have just kept my stupid mouth closed. \nMe and Jasmine was still in the bedroom.We were sitting down on her bed. \n\"So who's the other human you said was here?', I asked when I managed to calm down a little. I was curious on who she or he was. \n\"Her name is Isabelle, but we call her Izzy. She's the only other human here. She was here since she was 8, she's 20 now.\", she said sighing a little. She was only 8? Who in hell makes a 8 year old a slave, even for vampires. \n\"She was just a little girl?\", I said, getting a little mad. \n\"Well, she wasn't a slave in till she hit 13. Before she was 13, she was mostly just in a room. Master Lucas didn't even mean to have her here. When he was in your world. One of the other pixies that was with him found her, alone in an ally, cold, sick, starving, and young..\", she sighed again, \"The pixie that was with the Master name was Cameron, she was a caring pixie. More caring then I am. She begged the Master to bring Izzy here and have her as a slave.\", \nThe story, it wowed me. \"Wow..\", I said low. Jasmine nodded her head, \"So where is she? Where in the palace?\", I asked. \n\"Right now, I think she's either cleaning the break room, or cleaning Master Lucas room.\", she said. \"Speaking of Master Lucas, we better go show him you awake.\", she said getting up from the bed. Ugh, I don't want to see him. I don't even wanna say his name. Why would I want to see someone that kidnapped me and made me his slave? I didn't get up from the bed. I felt Jasmine hand wrapped around my arm and lifted me up from the bed. Damn she's to strong! \"Come on, Dorinda.\", she said. \n\"But I don't want too!\", I said, falling on the ground, my arm wide up in the arm from Jasmine holding it. \n\"Oh Heaven to Betsy.\", she said, sounded annoyed, \"Please, I could get in toruble if you don't come.\", she said, her voice sounded so much like a beg, which I hate it when people do that. Since I don't want her to get in trouble, because she does seem nice, I guess I have to. \n\"Fine.\", I said getting up from the floor. She let go of my arm and we made our way to the door. We stepped in the hallway. Which was freaking long as hell! I saw many and I mean many doors as we made are way down. We went pass a few other hall way. We finally got to a stair case that didn't seem so long. \nWe made are way up them and we only had to walk through two hallways. We finally got a door that said, 'Main Office'. Jasmine knocked on the door three time. \n\"Come in.\", I heard a hard voice. Great, my life gonna get worse in matter of seconds. Jasmine open the door and stepped in and I followed her in. It felt much colder in here. The room look a little like a small library. There was bookshelves on each side of the room. The walls that weren't being covered by the bookshelves were wood. There was no carpet, just wooded floor. There was an office desk were Lucas was sitting at. \nJasmine put her hands together and laying them straight down. She tilt her head down a little but her eyes where at the desk. \nLucas was looking down at some paper. I could only tell he was wearing a black button up shirt. His head then went up and he rubbed his eyes, \"Finally.\" he said, looking at me now, \"I never met a human that can sleep more then 18 hours.\", he said. What? I was sleeping for that long. I never sleep that long, but I guess that what happens when your punched in the face by a vampire. \n\"I wouldn't have if you hadn't punched me in the face.\", I said hard, crossing my arms over my chest. \n\"Well.\", he said getting up from the chair from the desk and I saw he wore normal blue jeans, \"For some reason I couldn't glamour you, and I really didn't feel like dragging you out, kicking and screaming, even though it would be easy for me, though. So it was either bite you and make you faint, or punch you. Which one would you rather had me do?', he said, laying both his hands on the desk and leaning down on it. \nI felt my blood pressure go up, I didn't really want to answer that cause I didn't and don't want to either. \"My family are probably worrying about me.\", I said. \n\"Probably. But they'll just think your dead. In a few months, they'll stop looking for you and just forget you.\" He was now making me more mad. He's so mean and horrible, \"Thank you.\", he said, growing a smirk on his face, damn mind reader, \"In comes in handy. But anyways, enjoy your new life. You'll be here the rest of your life.\", he then sat back down in the chair. \nMy mouth was hanging open. I couldn't believe this! He's actually going to make me stay here! I don't even want to be near him. What makes I want to be here? \n\n\n"
