      "page_number_1": "\"Dig, dig, dig. Dig down deep. Find the ore and dig it out. Swing the pick, tooth, and claw. Keep on digging down!\" The kobold mining crew's chants repeated repeatedly in the dark depths of the Crimson Claw Cavern. All down the line, soot-covered kobolds dressed only in threadbare protection swung in unison as they expanded their warren further down into the depths in search of new secrets and treasures to claim as their own.\nBoss Prakibak scowled as he paced back and forth along the digging crew, his yellow teeth exposed in his snarls. He is a tall, deep-red scaled kobold with sinuous muscle and imposing frills. Though his horns are small, he makes up for their lack with his sharpened claws and gnashing teeth. \"Keep it up, keep it up. You diggers need to move faster. Uplanders are coming down. They trampled our hatchery. Our young, the future of the tribe, was damaged beyond repair. We must dig deeper to escape their greed. All hidden from the burning skyfire is ours right now; now is the time to claim what is ours. We are dragons, the true rulers of this world! Dig, as befits your heritage!\"\nOne of the diggers, a young girl named Tik Tik, struck the earth with her scrawny arms. She lifts the pick, panting heavily before swinging it down again, striking the rock with a pathetic thing.\nPrakibak stomped forward and scowled down at Tik Tik. \"You call that a swing? What kind of kobold are you if you can't dig!\"\nTik Tik held up a finger and replied. \"I worked as a trapper's apprentice. I am no brute laborer.\"\nPrakibak snarled, \"So, you're responsible for the uplanders getting to our eggs...\"\nTik Tik gasped. \"Absolutely not! All of my traps were unsprung! They came in from the other side, where Lishnash worked. I was protecting the south by the fairy forest, and-\"\nPrakibak's claw slammed the wall right beside Tik Tik's face. The pink kobold winced and backed up against the wall.\nThe larger kobold leered at her, his teeth filling his muzzle. He snorted, hot air passing over Tik Tik's heart-shaped nose, causing it to wrinkle. \"Well, if you were any good at yer job, you would have checked all the entrances, wouldn't you have?\"\nTik Tik opened one of her blue eyes, her teeth gritted together not in a display of dominance but in abject fear. \"T-that w-was Quiquan's job,\" she objected.\nHis other hand slammed on the wall on the other side of her face, effectively pinning her against the rock. \"Doesn't matter! We have an egg shortage now because of poor trappers! The breeders are working from shroomglow to mushdim and adding to the tribe. And what are you all doing? Making ineffective traps and swinging your pathetic, weak arms at the rock. Maybe I'll have the Queen put you on breeder duty instead. How does that sound, eh? I bet you'd do really well at that. In fact, I'd be happy to give you your first egg.\"\nTik Tik's face burned as he talked on about that, and as his clawed hand moved from the rock to her cheek, she hissed, grabbing his hand and staring him down. \"Do not treat me like a slave! We are working together, Prakibak! And it was the Queen who put me here!\"\nPrakibrak freed his hand, an easy task against the smaller, tired, and weakened kobold. He held his arm aloft, hand clenched in a fist, staring down at her with his bright orange eyes filled with fury. His chest rose. His nostrils flared, and he snarled, slamming his fist on the rock wall right by her head!\nTik Tik sensed it first--a rumble beneath her feet. She curled her toes and whimpered, looking up to Prakibak. His eyes widened, and, for that moment, she didn't see the stubborn and angry dig boss but a fellow kobold, one worried about the safety of his people. He turned around and shouted. \"Quake! Get out of the tunnel! Go, now!\" He grabbed Tik Tik's arm and pulled her away from the wall, her hands resting on his firm yet soft-scaled chest as he wrapped his arms around her. The ground beneath their feet gave way, and she yipped in surprise, holding tighter onto him as the two found themselves slipping off their feet and falling down the new hole. Suddenly, a loose bit of stone struck the dig boss, causing him to let go of her. She shrieked, and he gasped, reaching out to try and grab her again, but he missed, and the two tumbled separately down, with the screams of their fellows ringing through their ears.\nTik Tik awoke, her pink scales caked in dust and dirt and her working clothes torn, with droplets of dried blood on her arms and legs. She groaned and got on her knees, shaking off loose rubble from her head. She poked at her frills and traced a finger over her horns, sighing in relief as they were unharmed. She then tested her tail, flicking it back and forth. Everything seemed alright. She stood and glanced around. The chamber she stood in was natural, devoid of the marks of any sentient race's pickaxe or chisel. She stepped along the darkness. The ground felt like an ancient river had worn the floor. But it had dried up long ago.\nA groan caught her attention, and she gasped, running up to the trapped kobold. Prakibak's tail and one of his legs were caught underneath a reasonably large boulder. Tik Tik dropped to his side, and examined over the rock, frowning.\n\"Damn, quakes!\" Prakibak muttered, his claws scraping at the ground. \"It'll throw back construction for at least a week, figurin' out the weaknesses in the rock!\"\n\"Do not try to move,\" Tik Tik said, running her fingers over the stone. \"This could shift and crush you.\"\n\"I'm already crushed!\" He snarled. \"Why don't you try something useful and go find some help? Scurry along like a good little girl.\"\nTik Tik froze, and then stood up, folding her arms over her chest. Her tail slapped the ground as she narrowed her eyes. She scrutinized the once large and impressive kobold, reduced to a barking wyrmling. \"You weren't very nice to me up in the mine. You wanted to transfer me to breeding duty.\"\n\"Yeah? So? Did you really think you'd be better chipping away at that rock all your life?\" He asked. He coughed and groaned. \"At least you'd be having fun and being productive as a breeder.\"\nTik Tik sighed and tapped the rock. \"I'll go find some help. Don't do anything stupid.\" With that, she walked off down the path of the ancient river. Just as he left, she paused and looked over her shoulder. \"I will only use my body if I can also stimulate my mind. Tell me how breeding can do that, and I might consider it.\"\nTik Tik crept along the cave. Being alone and unarmed meant she had little chance of fighting off any monster that lived in the darkness. As a weak little kobold, she had no means of defending herself, so all of her senses were on overdrive. She sniffed the stale air, felt the disturbances in the floor and walls, listened to the creaks and drips echoing from the far-off chambers, tasted the mustiness of the air, and finally saw the light beyond.\nShe paused. Light meant trouble. Light meant creatures who couldn't see in the dark. Light meant uplanders. Tik Tik leaned forward, her tail raised, squinting as he saw more of the light and the small tent where the light source rested. Tik Tik pressed herself to the wall, shimmying her way over, being as slow and quiet as possible. Her chin pressed against the wall, impairing her vision as she looked up. Anyone watching her would surely catch her off guard. She made it as far as the edge of the tent, looking out the corner of her eye to examine the fabric. Small shadows clung to its walls, yet none of them moved; none of them looked organic. Tik Tik raised a toe and poked at the lining of the tent. She pierced through with little resistance. She licked her lips and brought her toe around the edge of the tent, creating a flap. She ducked down and peeked her head in, pulling her head back out and rubbing her eyes. It hurt like the fire in the uplands, and it hurt so much, she hissed in reflex.\nWithout hesitation, she clapped her hands over her mouth and opened one eye partially, darting her gaze back and forth over the scene. There was nothing at the camp. Just the tent, the nasty light, and the things inside. \"Must find help,\" she spoke to herself. \"Must push through.\" She kept her eyes shut as she wriggled in through the hole. First, her head, then her shoulders, and finally, she pulled her arms through. Blinded, she knocked over a small stool, which knocked into the lamp and knocked it over. The light immediately disappeared with the sound of a slight hum. Tik Tik paused, surprised by the sudden darkness. When nothing immediately happened, she opened her eyes once more.\nThe tent was furnished only with a bed roll, a small chest, an upturned stool, and a small writing desk. Tik Tik stood, finding it easy to stand at full height with plenty of headroom. Whoever used this shelter must have been much taller than the average kobold. Tik Tik coughed, catching the whiff of dust in the air. She squatted down, placed a hand upon the bedroll, and pulled it back to see the shape of her handprint. \"Abandoned...\" she said. \"Long time. How did an uplander get here?\" she asked. If there is a way to the uplands, there is a way out for a kobold to find help. Perhaps the mysterious traveler left a map.\nEven a map not made by expert Kobold's hands would be enough to orient her. To that end, she investigated the chest. She approached it and licked her lips, rubbing her hands together. She pressed her cheek to the lock and waited a moment--no sound. She then rapped her knuckles on one side and then the other. Everything sounded consistent. It wasn't trapped. However, the thing was still locked. She frowned and turned to a broken, shattered device lying on the ground. A metal frame with glass fragments all around it. It must be the light source, but it lay broken now. She snaked her tail toward it and hooked the tip over a ring on top of the device. Pulling it in close, she grabbed it and flipped it around, once, twice, three times. Once she had a good handle on the thing, she found the weak point and slammed it against the ground. A small piece of metal broke free, and she tossed the rest of the husk away. With a few twists of the loosened strip, she fashioned a tiny pick, which she inserted into the lock. With a click, the chest opened, and she peered inside.\nWithin, there were scraps of paper and a curious thing. Bound in leather with designs of gold on the front, this mysterious item intrigued her. She picked it up first. Inside, many pages were glued to the casing. She frowned as she looked it over. What matter of device would this be? Some kind of paper holder? She opened it up, and her eyes widened. Words! Words written in the tongue of dragons, the tongue of the kobold race! She drank in the knowledge held within, sitting back on the bedroll as she did. These words were directions on how to speak the actual words of power... the words of magic.\nCould she use magic? She flipped further in and frowned. Unfamiliar words filled the pages now--words and pictures. She placed a hand over one of those pictures. She recognized the more immense horror drawn here. This thing with a maw that could swallow a kobold whole, with many tangled arms. It is a burrower, but the thing underneath is a mystery. Built like a Kobold, it would be much taller and fattier, with fur upon its head and a flat, tiny snout. But the most intriguing part wasn't the creature itself, but the fact that it was held up by the borrower by its arms and legs, and its legs spread wide, with the burrower's other arms going up between them until they reached--\nPrakibak shouted her name and Tik Tik closed the book, holding it tightly as she scrambled out of the tent.\nTik Tik scurried from the old abandoned campsite. Prakibak had called for her, and she couldn't leave the injured dig boss alone. After all, it is a kobold's duty to see after the well-being of their tribe, and those above a kobold in rank needed to be protected for the good of them all. She arrived at the site and panted, dropping to her knees beside the injured foreman and looking him over with a frantic concern. \"What? What is wrong?\"\nPrakibak, lying on his back with the collapsed stone on his leg and tail, looked up to Tik Tik with his once-powerful orange eyes. \"You... you were taking too long,\" he admitted. I need a report more often.\"\nTik Tik blinked, but a smile ran across her face. \"Boss... are you scared?\"\n\"No!\" he snapped, sneering and showing off his impressive teeth.\n\"It's alright if you are,\" Tik Tik said. She reached out and placed a hand upon one of his impressive frills. The dig boss flinched at her touch, and she frowned. \"Dig crew will come to save us,\" she said. \"We can't get out with you like this. Even if I free you, you'll be too hurt to move. So, I'll stay beside you.\" She sat back, placing the book she found at the campsite upon her lap.\n\"What's that?\" he asked, unable to shift to a comfortable position to correctly see it.\nShe flipped through the pages and stuck to the words she could recognize. \"It's a book I found at an abandoned uplander camp\"\n\"Book? Pah. Waste of space. Sheets are much better and are easy to carry only what you need. No wonder uplander camp was abandoned if they carried something heavy and useless around.\"\n\"Not useless!\" Tik Tik said, stopping on a specific page. \"Magic! I think I can ease your pain, Dig Boss!\" She stood up, facing the rocks. \"If this is correct, all I need to do is speak in dragon tongue to you.\" She brushed her finger along the page and recited the incantation that promised the freedom of movement.\n\"How are you supposed to touch me if you're busy holding that carcass-covered weight?\" Prakibak scoffed. You shouldn't waste your ti-\"\nTik Tik pressed the sole of her foot upon the Dig Boss's cheek, applying pressure enough to shut him up as she scanned over the page. Prakibak growled at the indignity of it, but as her words filled the air, they both felt the transfer of power issuing out from the book, coursing through Tik Tik's body and entering into Prakibak.\nWith renewed vigor and a sudden feeling of fleet-footedness, Prakibak dug his hands into the dirt floor. Surprisingly, he slid right out from under the rock with a loud \"pop.\" With tail and claw out from under the stones, the remains of the cave-in settled down, kicking up even more dust around them.\nPrakibak growled, sitting up and feeling around his swollen appendage. \"I need a healer for this,\" he muttered. \"There are no healing spells in your book, are there?\"\nTik Tik shook her head. \"Not from what I can read,\" she said, \"but you are safe now. We'll wait here for rescue, then see the healer.\" She sat down next to him this time. \"Read with me, to make the time go faster?\"\nHe rolled his eyes. \"What else am I going to do?\" he asked, leaning back on his hands. He draped the tip of his poor, swollen tail over the ankle of his good leg.\nTik Tik flipped the page to the diagram she had left off on, with the burrower mounted upon the strange fleshy creature. Prakibak's eyes widened at the sight, and he shut the book right over Tik Tik's hand. She yelped and pulled it free, shaking it off.\n\"Ow! What the hell?\"\n\"That's no good!\" he barked. \"Throw it away, Tik Tik.\"\n\"What's the matter with you?\" she asked, scooting away. He grabbed her arm, keeping her from leaving.\n\"Kobolds should not see such things,\" he said, his eyes angered, yet his hand trembled.\nShe placed her hand on his and tilted her head. \"What's the matter? What's wrong with the book?\"\nHe licked over his teeth, his lips twitching. \"It's... against the tribe's need,\" he said. \"Relations outside of the tribe, outside of kobold kind, they are no good.\"\nShe considered the book again and said, \"I won't pay attention to that. I'll see if there's anything that can help us, that's all.\"\nHe hissed, yet he let go of her. \"This will only lead to trouble. I'm only trying to help,\"\nShe held a hand up in front of his face and opened the book again, scanning page after page as he grumbled quietly.\nSome time passed, and Prakibak fell asleep, laying face up on the ground to not roll over onto his injured foot. Tik Tik, meanwhile, kept up her studies. Undoubtedly, the fleshy creature under the burrower was a \"human,\" as the book made many references to them. A human wrote it, which made some of the entries rather frustrating to decipher. Of course, once the diagrams showed humans interacting with other humans, she finally figured out the purpose of the tome. She had walked by the breeding grounds on her way to trap passages before, seeing as the tribe's men loomed over unclothed females, their legs spread, tails raised, hooking over the male's shoulders. She noticed their expressions, the men forceful and angered, the females bored, squirming masses. Where was the fun in such work? Yet here, as she read about the humans and the forms they took in their rituals, gazing upon the art depicting the faces, strange as they were, in apparent signs of happiness. She leaned in, taking in as much as she could from work, and as she did, she felt something rise from within the pit of her being, and a tingle of excitement arose from her mind. These creatures were having so much fun, and they could have this fun not just with themselves but with other beings. Burrowers are creatures like humans with pointy ears, shorter ones with furry faces, larger ones twice their size, and...\nHer eyes widened, and her very core shook at the sight. She pressed her finger against the illustration and swallowed the saliva that had formed in her mouth. There, written in the plainest of draconic, was a guide entitled \"Seducing the Dragons.\"\nPrakibak grumbled and groaned, then sat up straight. Tik Tik slammed her book closed, crossing her legs and groaning in annoyance. She shot him a heated glance but frowned at the sight.\nThe dig boss panted, cold sweats glistening on his scales. He looked around, his chest rising and falling at an alarming rate. When he saw Tik Tik, he relaxed slightly and grumbled an apology.\n\"No need,\" Tik Tik said. \"Is something wrong?\"\n\"Just...\" he ran a hand through his frills. \"No, it's nothing.\"\n\"You're worried, right?\" she asked, closing her book. She bit her lip and looked over her shoulder. In the time they spent down here, there had been no sign of predators or uninvited guests. They were well and truly alone. \"Maybe I can help you relax,\" she asked.\nHe jumped. \"What? I'm perfectly fine, I- What are you doing!?\"\nTik Tik pulled her ripped work clothes free, exposing her body to him. She folded them neatly and placed them aside, crawling up before him, and placing a hand upon his thigh. \"Isn't this what you wanted?\" she asked. \"For me to be useful to the tribe?\"\nHe inhaled deeply through his nose and shook his head. \"Tik Tik, this isn't the time. This isn't the breeding grounds-\"\n\"Shh...\" she stopped him, pressing a finger to his mouth. She lifted one leg and placed it down on the other side of him, straddling his lap. Her hands ran down along his frills and rested upon his shoulders. \"This isn't for breeding. This is for saving my life.\"\n\"Saving your life?\" He laughed. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\"When we fell,\" she said, narrowing her gaze, leaning in, pressing their foreheads together, \"you sought to protect me. I saw it in your eyes, the real you...\"\nHe gulped, his hands twitching on the ground. \"Tik Tik, I was just doing my job, my duty.\"\n\"Do you ever wonder what it's like to do something for yourself?\" she asked. \"Or for someone else, and not for everyone?\"\n\"What you're talking about... it's not something we do, not in the tribe.\"\nShe pulled herself up against him, her underbelly pressing against his still-clothed chest. She hissed into his ear and whispered, \"The tribe isn't here. It's just us, and we need to help each other.\"\nREPORT",
      "page_number_2": "A growl rose from the back of his throat, and he grabbed her wrists. Her eyes opened to look at his, and he snarled, saying, \"You're teasing me, Tik Tik. I can't mount you like this.\"\n\"I know you want to,\" Tik Tik said, and she pushed up against him, her hips grinding against his body, against that bulge in his leggings.\nHe tilted his head back and groaned. \"I know I want to, but I'm telling you, I can't!\"\n\"I'm telling you,\" she breathed out, her hand moving down to his sides, gripping his tunic. \"You don't have to.\"\n\"I... what? What are you talking about?\" he asked as she lifted his top.\n\"Arms up,\" she commanded, and he did as he was told without knowing why. She lifted his shirt off him and tossed it aside, her hand brushing over his underbelly.\nHe chittered, digging his hand back into the ground, shaking his head \"W... what is this? What are you-?\"\n\"Does it feel good?\" she asked, leaning in now. She huffed a breath of hot air through her nostrils, sending shivers up his spine.\n\"Aah... I don't... I don't under... what!?\"\nHer tongue rolled out, pressing up along his flesh. She tasted the salty brine of sweat and musk, her eyes rolling back as she continued the lick up along him, remembering the diagrams she saw and applying them to her knowledge of kobold anatomy. The erogenous zones of a humanoid tended to fill specific areas of sensitivity; the sensitive underbelly of a Kobold should prove to be a source of pleasure for their kind. By Prakibak's twitching and wide-mouthed state, she could tell her hypothesis was correct. So fascinating!\nShe licked up to his chin and pulled her tongue back, meeting his eyes once more. \"You want more?\" she asked.\nHe stared at her, dumbfounded. \"W... what even was that!?\"\n\"Just something I picked up,\" she admitted, her fingers following the trail of her tongue as her other arm draped over his shoulder. She moved those fingers back down the path, going beneath his underbelly to his leggings. The whole while, he shuddered under her, a soft growl emerging from his lips, but he didn't nip her, didn't chastise her. \"I'll show you much more of what I learned if you ask.\"\n\"If I... I'm your boss!' he gasped. \"You can't barter with me!\"\nHer fingers stopped, and she sighed. \"Yes, sorry. Will leave now...\" she said, lifting her leg to roll off him.\n\"N-no, wait!\" he gasped, his chest heaving, his body slick. He squeezed his eyes shut and grit his teeth, cursing at what he was about to say. She waited, holding her breath, her eyes widening at the indecisive mess he had become, all from some simple touch!\nHe gasped and grabbed her hand, yanking her back against him, the two slapping underbellies together. Their noses touched, and Tik Tik gasped, waiting to see what he meant by this gesture until...!\nHe rocked his head back and forth, and Tik Tik's eyes welled up. This gruff, mean, horny kobold, who had threatened her previously, was now rubbing noses with her; the ultimate gesture, the most forbidden of things, signs of camaraderie, appreciation, and care. The kobold's language had no word for it, but the meaning was crystal clear.\nShe wiped her eyes clean and yipped, saying, \"Then... let's continue!\"\n\"It's alright. I've read up on it. It should be very simple. Besides, you aren't doing anything with this. I am!\" Tik Tik chirps happily, sitting at the foot of the dig boss, her scaled pink body on full display as she sits on her knees, hands resting right on top of them. \"I'll be careful. Don't you worry about that?\"\n\"It's not that I'm worried about,\" he says. \"This can't possibly be something a male should do.\"\n\"Males do it all the time,\" she says, leaning forward. Her fingers brush over his ankles, keeping away from his injured foot. Her claws brush up along his scales, making her boss shudder from her touch.\n\"You're... you're reading that right, aren't you?\" He asks.\"Shh...\" the female kobold hushes him, sliding up closer onto him, her hands moving to the inside of his legs and spreading him at the knee. She hooks her hand under his injured leg, making sure to lift it ever so carefully as she sets it aside, giving him a less pained reception to the motion. Despite this, he does groan slightly, yet the semi-hard mast in front of her face shows her that he is not entirely turned off by the idea. Soon, her face is right there, nose right in front of his burgeoning hard-on. The curious kobold sniffs, taking in the natural musk of the dig boss, a mix of kobold sweat and the dust of the earth. Her heart is all aflutter. Only the most active workers would have the smell of the earth suffused to their very beings. \"You smell wonderful, Prakibak,\" she coos.\n\"Uh, th-thanks, so... so now you're gonna...?\"\nShe lifts her head slightly, her blue eyes half-lidded as she looks at him, nodding and giving him a delighted \"mmmm-hmm...\"\nHe gulps.\nShe lifts one hand, bringing up away from him. Her mouth opens, and her tongue rolls out. She presses her finger to it and, with the precision of a trap maker, coats the digit with a thin layer of her saliva, ensuring her tongue wraps around the length of her finger and pushes the thing into her mouth. She keeps her eyes on the dig boss, who, according to their agreement, would keep his hands behind his head for this procedure. She closes her maw around it to get the finger nice and wet, then pulls it out with a \"pop\" and looks at the film-covered digit. She wiggles it in front of him and says. \"I've put this finger in such tiny places, Dig Boss. If this diagram is to be believed, once I put this in the right spot, you'll forget all of your troubles.\"\nPrakibak looks upwards, away from the cute kobold in front of him. She lifts her tail, wiggling it back and forth as she hums the worker's tune.\n\"H... hey!\" he says, looking down at her. \"This ain't no tunnel dig!\" he says.\nHer finger presses against him, up against the ring that is his tail hole. \"Isn't it?\"\nHe grits his teeth, closes his eyes, and hisses. \"B... be gentle.\"\n\"You're such a hatchling,\" she coos, swirling her finger over that ring. \"Don't worry. This may be my first time, but I'm a quick learner.\"\n\"Tell that to the wall you were hacking at!\" he teased but immediately regretted it as he felt the finger penetrate inside of him. His mouth opens wide, and the slightest of gasps escapes from his throat.\n\"There you go,\" she whispers, leaning in, puffing out hot air from her nose onto his length. It twitches to attention. \"And it looks like you're enjoying it, too.\"\n\"I... Is this what it feels like?\" he asks, his arms trembling. \"When I breed a f-female?\"\n\"I doubt that,\" she says. \"According to the book, there's no natural lubrication in the tail hole.\" She pushes her finger deeper, wriggling it. \"Please try to relax, as I could possibly tear it.\"\nHe sniffles and whines, \"Why didn't you warn me about that sooner?\" He asks.\nShe reaches over with her free hand and turns the book's page. \"I said I was a quick learner, not that I learned everything at once. Oooh, this looks promising.\"\n\"W... what does?\" Prakibak asks, but he finds himself gasping as she pushes further in. \"Nnngh... ho-how deep are you going to go!\"\n\"Just a bit further, but perhaps this will ease your mind?\" She says this and rolls out her tongue, letting the tip flick at the head of his kobold cock.\nPrakibak hisses in a breath, not in discomfort or strangeness, but delight.\n\"Ah, I knew you'd like that one. You big strong men, always thinking with this digging tool.\" She swirls the tongue around the tip, and he relaxes in her actions.\n\"Wh... what was that...?\" he asks, his eyes half-lidded in his stupor.\n\"Another thing I learned from the book,\" Tik Tik replies. \"I learned so much in such a short time. Imagine how powerful its magic must be.\"\nHe blinks, then frowns. \"No, wait. That sounds extremely dangero-ooooh!\"\nShe slides the pole up along her tongue, keeping that muscle inside of her snout. She lowers her head down, his tip pressing the roof of her mouth, effectively wrapping it around her draconic maw. She lowers her head more over him, pushing his meat between the more rigid roof and the softer, wet tongue. She pulls back just as his length gets to her throat, keeping herself from choking on it, but pulling back with the same slow intensity as when she pushes down.\nMeanwhile, her fingers probe within him, feeling the strange, tight cavern, wriggling her finger around within. There had to be something there, something for Tik Tik to find. His groans tell her he likes what she is doing, yet she doesn't quite feel what the book describes. But then her finger probes at the right spot at the correct instance and...\nPrakibak erupts, shooting white hot streams down into Tik Tik's throat. She pulls her face back, ripping her hand out and holding her neck. She coughs, sitting on her knees as cum dribbles off of her chin.\nPrakibak pushes himself up, placing pressure on his injured foot and sending pain shooting up his body. He yowls and falls back down. \"I'm sorry. Tik Tik, are you alright?\"\nHe sees her slowly stand up, facing away from him, and then her head turns, a bright blue eye staring down at him from over her shoulder, her claws itching. Then she spins around, her front glistening from his ejaculate over her, and she yips happily. \"That was exciting!\"\n\"Tik Tik,\" the dig boss whines. \"You had me worried. I... I thought I hurt you.\"\n\"Oh, don't worry about me!\" Tik Tik said, bouncing on her toes. \"I read the book, remember? I know what to do and what not to do. I didn't expect you to be so virile, though!\"\n\"Hey!\" he growls. Are you saying I'm not kobold enough to fill a breeder? I'll let you know I personally fathered many of the dig force... I think.\"\nShe giggles, stepping close to him and examining his body. \"We should relax, I think, and conserve our energy.\"\n\"You say that after you drink my life force?\"\n\"You say that when you forced it down my throat?\"\nHe grumbled and folded his arms over his chest.\nThe two sit in silence, looking away from one another. After a few minutes, Prakibak speaks up.\n\"It, uh, it felt good.\"\n\"Thank you,\" Tik Tik replies curtly.\nSilence again.\n\"So, uh... is there anything you want me to do for you?\" Prakibak asks.\nTik Tik shrugs and brings the book to her lap, licking her toes together as she flips through some pages. \"No, I think you've done quite enough exertion for now. Tell me, though, how are you feeling?\"\n\"How am I...?\" he starts. \"I'm in pain. I have a broken foot and a crushed tail. How do you think I feel?\"\n\"Right, I apologize. I just wish the relief these actions give were more permanent. You're much too exhausted to try something else.\"\n\"Exhausted?\" Prakibak huffs. He pushes himself up by his elbows, his arms quivering. \"I'll show you exhausted. I'm a dig boss, not some lowly wyrmling.\"\n\"Is that so?\" Tik Tik asked, leaning back now, using her hands to support herself. Then, why don't you come over here and prove it?\" she asked, her legs slightly spreading, showing the dig boss her glistening moistness. \"I'm waiting for you.\" Her challenge came to him as a purr from the back of her throat, her eyes lidded in seductive teasing.\nPrakibak's eyes widen at the sight, and he grits his teeth as he rolls onto his stomach. He gets up on his knees, lifting up his injured foot. With a growling determination, he crawls, hand over hand, knee over knee, hissing as his broken toes scrape against the ground. It is an arduous journey, having to turn around to face her, but soon, his hands grab the lady kobold's ankles, and he hisses triumphantly.\nTik Tik remains how she is, leaning back and tilting her head, humming to herself as she waits.\nPrakibak scowls and climbs steadily upward, hand over hand, his grip tight along her scales. Tik Tik can no longer suppress her smile as the dig boss works his way up along her, seeking to get to her once and for all. But, even as his kobold-hood reaches its spear-tipped length, Tik Tik reaches up and places a hand upon the dig boss's frills. Prakibak pauses, looking at her quizzically before she shoves his face down right into her crotch!\nPrakibak reaches up for her wrist, but Tik Tik shoves his face down into her, shaking her head. \"No, no... I gave you some fun with my mouth. You have to do the same for me!\"\nThe dig boss snarls, his vibrating lips kissing hers, causing Tik Tik to shudder at the sensation. In his weakened state, he can do nothing about it, and eventually, he relents. \"You'll regret this,\" he says. \"You can't humiliate me like this.\"\n\"It's only humiliation if you want it to be. You're always in charge. How is it that you're letting a weak little girl keep your face down? It can only mean that you're doing it on purpose and want me to boss you around, dig boss.\"\nHe doesn't respond.\n\"That's a good Prakibak,\" she coos. \"Now, please, use your tongue...\" she strokes a finger over his frills, sending a shiver down the dig boss's cheeks.\nEagerly now, the dig boss closes his eyes and shoots his reptilian tongue out of his mouth. The wet muscle dances at Tik Tik's slit, which causes her to respond with a sigh and a coo. She pets him, being gentle, even in her dominance. He presses his tongue to the lips and licks, once, twice, three times, before he decides to try something different and slide it inside of her.\nTik Tik gasps, her legs lifting up over his shoulders now. He is surprised by her flexibility, but he keeps it up, even after the kobold wraps her legs around his head, pulling him in. He holds his hands under her thighs as a means of support, going down on her, eagerly tasting her honey.\nThe two remain there, enjoying each other's company for a few blissful moments, when, with the speed mustered only by a Kobold search and rescue team, the wall beside them collapses, revealing a set of diggers all peering in.\nPrakibak lifts his head, his maw glistening from female love and gulps.\nTik Tik looks over her shoulder, flutters her eyes, and says \"Took you long enough.\"\nTik Tik walks past all of the tribe on her way up from the collapsed room. The rescue team who found her and Prakibak would not allow her to dress after they had discovered them in their compromising position. Two of the team carried the confiscated articles, but the one she kept her eyes on was not the one with her clothes but the one with the book.\nShe can feel the eyes of all of the tribe on her, passing through the different sections as the rescue team leads her through. They passed the digging crew, the trappers, the breeders, and even the hatchery itself. She stands tall, though, letting them see her as exposed as she is. She knows that they didn't need to pass through all of the tribe's lands. They wanted everyone to see her. And, seeing the glances from some of the younger among the rescue squad, it is safe to say they wished to see her, too. The more she exposes herself to the dressed kobolds, the more she strides confidently to her final destination.\nThe air is awkward between her and the rescue team, as none speak to her after separating her from the injured dig boss. Supposedly, the healers were dispatched to work their cures upon him, but she doubts she'll find out any time soon with this parade.\nThe escort leads her to a narrower corridor, ending in a curtained exit guarded by two kobolds larger and more frightening than Prakibak. Out of all the places they could have taken her, they sent her here--the antechamber to the Queen's Quarters.\nThe guards eye Tik Tik with stern, growling faces, and she hunches over, shrinking slightly. That confidence and defiance she developed during the trip here suddenly vanishes now that the prying eyes linger and do not disappear into the darkness.\nThe Captain of the rescue, a green kobold named Kishke, raises her fist to signal the company to halt. She bows her head before the guards, and they raise their spears, allowing her to pass through the curtains. She turns to the two team members carrying TIk Tik's things and takes the confiscated goods from them before she finally makes the journey through the portal.\nThe next few minutes are silent. The chill of the cave brushes over Tik Tik's scales. Leering eyes glance over her body, but she takes a deep breath and holds her head up high. Their looks are just that--looks. They would not dare touch someone destined to stand before the Queen.\nKishke returns and keeps a close eye on Tik Tik. She points back to the curtains with her thumb and says, \"Her Majesty will see you now. Rescue Team, dismissed!\"\nThe kobolds all disperse in an unorganized mob, each heading back a different way through the tunnels to return to their regularly scheduled duty. Of course, some leave with one final parting glance before disappearing entirely. Tik TIk narrows her gaze as she meets one, who looks away, scurrying off with renewed purpose.\nThe Captain passes by the naked kobold and snorts, saying, \"I don't know what got into you, but good luck.\" She claps Tik Tik on the shoulder and smiles. \"She said she wished to dispense your punishment herself.\"\n\"I'll be fine,\" Tik Tik says, forcing a smile. \"She wouldn't hurt me for such a little thing... right?\"\nKishke shrugs and continues on, leaving Tik Tik alone with the guards. They move their spears, spreading the curtain wide enough for her to pass through. But, as she does, her eyes sting.\nThe room gleams with the glitter of gold. Kobold Engineering worked overtime to establish this bright chamber for the Queen. Miles of tunnels and mirrors worked together to let the bright sun beam down from the sky above to this treasure horde. She recalls working on some measurements with her Master, who warned her not to look at the apparatus while the cover above was removed. A kobold staring directly at that sky fire would surely lose her sight, but not their Queen.\n\"It's been quite the alarming day, little one,\" comes the husky voice of their monarch. The voice comes from the other side of the room where she lounges upon the \"throne,\" which is little more than a slab of rock with a banner of a defeated kingdom draped over it as a sheet. Every ounce of gold that the tribe doesn't use for trade with others lies strewn about the throne in piles. Tik Tik must bring her hand up to cover the light in order to even see the shape of the Queen.\nThe queen lounges upon her throne bed, one hand upon her egg-laying hip and another turning a page from Tik Tik's tome. \"You found yourself quite the treasure, dear,\" she says, a growl. \"But, I hardly think it's appropriate for our tribe to see such things.\"\nTik Tik takes a step forward, placing her hands on her hips as she barks up. \"It is a study of magic. Surely, that could be of help to the tribe.\"\n\"Magic!?\" the figure draped in light laughs. \"Oh, yes, I'm sure you like this work purely for academic purposes.\"\nTik Tik frowns. There's no arguing against the Queen in that regard. \"It helped save Prakibak,\" she mentions.\n\"Yes, yes, I know,\" the Queen says. \"And how delightful that is, but there really isn't much in here you can learn that will help us out. Such... hm... study is not effective in keeping our tribe thriving. Sure, there are ways to spice up the breeding process, but really...\" she says, slamming the book shut. \"It's just a waste of time.\"\n\"It's not a waste of time!\" Tik Tik yipped. \"Prakibak and I, we gained a bond. I care more for him now. I want to see him again, to hold him again.\"\nA week has passed since the Queen related to Tik Tik her tale. While a slight lump of worry is nestled deep within her belly, the little kobold is more burdened with the excitement of the task ahead. The finest armorers of the tribe supplied her with traveling gear that would help her blend in the above world, and she beamed as she looked down over herself dressed in the green shirt and finely tailored traveler's pants. She wiggles her toes, feeling the shin-length foot wraps against her scales, made to keep her feet healthy for long travels ahead. She wraps the dark green cloak around her, hiding her face and running around her little changing room to let the cape billow.\nREPORT"
